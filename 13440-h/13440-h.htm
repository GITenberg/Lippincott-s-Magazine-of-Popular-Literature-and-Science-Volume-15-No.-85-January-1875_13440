    <p>In leaving Cologne for Aix-la-Chapelle you turn your back to
    the river&mdash;a particular which suited my mood well enough.
    The railway bore us away from the Rhine-shore at an abrupt
    angle, and in my notion the noble Germanic goddess or image
    seemed at this point to recede with grand theatric strides,
    like a divinity of the stage backing away from her admirers
    over the billowy whirlpool of her own skirts. As I dreamed we
    penetrated the tunnel of K&ouml;nigsdorf, which is fifteen
    hundred yards long, and which seemed to me sufficiently
    protracted to contain the slumber of Barbarossa. The thought
    gave me a useful hint, and I fell into a light sleep, while
    Charles and Hohenfels pervaded the darkness merely by their
    perfumes&mdash;the former with whiffs at a concealed bottle of
    Farina, the latter with a pastille counterfeiting the incense
    of the cathedral. In a couple of hours from the H&ocirc;tel de
    Hollande we reached Aachen, as the fond natives call the burgh
    so dear to Charlemagne. Deprived of that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> magnificent mirror, the
       Rhine, the pretty towns throughout this part of Germany seem
       but like country belles. We should hardly have paused at Aix
       but for the sake of affording a rest to Charles, who grew
       worse whenever lunch-time competed with railway-time. As for
       the dull little city, for us it was a wilderness, with the
       blank cleanliness of the desert, except in so far as it was
       informed and populated by the memory of Charlemagne.</p>

    <p>Here he died, and entered his tomb in the church himself had
    founded. Into this sepulchre the emperor Otho III. dared to
    penetrate in the year 997, impelled by a motive of vile and
    varlet-like curiosity. They say the dead monarch confronted his
    living visitor in the great marble chair in which he had been
    seated at his own command, haughty and inflexible as in life,
    the ivory sceptre in his ivory fingers, his white skull crowned
    with the diadem of gold. The peeping emperor looked upon him
    with awe, half afraid of the mysterious and penetrating shadows
    that reached forth out of his rayless eyes. Before he left,
    however, he peered about, touched the sceptre and the throne,
    fingered this and that, and having, as it were, trimmed the
    nails and combed the beard of the great spectre, retired with a
    valet's bow. Observing that Charlemagne had lost most of his
    nose, he caused it to be replaced in gold very delicately
    chiseled and enchased. The sacrilege was repeated by Frederick
    Barbarossa in 1165, who went farther and forced Charlemagne to
    get up from his chair before him. The corpse, in rising, fell
    in pieces, which have been dispersed through Europe as relics.
    We saw such of them as remain here at the Chapelle. I was
    allowed, for about the equivalent of an American dollar, to
    measure the Occidental emperor's leg&mdash;they call it his
    arm. And then, as a makeweight in the bargain, the venal
    sacristan placed in my hands the head of Charlemagne.</p>

    <p>I thought Hohenfels would have sunk to the ground with
    disgust. He colored deeply and dragged me into the air. "I am
    ashamed of every drop of German blood in my veins," he cried.
    "What are we to think of the commerce of these wretches, for
    whom the very wounds of C&aelig;sar are the lips of a
    money-box?"</p>

    <p>I had given back the skull, as Hamlet returns the skull of
    Yorick to the grave-digger, and was dusting my fingers with a
    handkerchief, as hundreds of Hamlets have dusted theirs. I
    said, "'Thrift, thrift, Horatio.'"</p>

    <p>"At Kreutzberg there are twenty monks on the counter! This
    morning, at St. Ursula's, it was the eleven thousand virgins,
    their skulls ranged like Dutch cheeses above our heads or in
    rows around the walls, with a battery-full of them in the
    neighboring apartment, like a cheesemonger's reserved magazine.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> Here, the very leader of
       modern ideas, the creator of our form of civilization, is
       shown for so many pennies to any grocer who wants to weigh
       the head of a king! Profanation! Barbarians!
       Philistines!"</p>

    <p>I turned rather hastily, while my hands were yet clammy with
    the skull, thinking that this accusation of Philistinism was
    aimed at me. But Hohenfels thought of nothing less than of a
    personality, being in his cloudiest mood of generalization. So
    I only concealed the handkerchief, while I said, as easily as I
    might, "You need not accuse your German blood, for I have lived
    long enough in my American's Paradise to know that civilized
    Paris is considerably worse in this particular respect, with
    the addition of a certain goblin levity particularly French.
    How often have I seen babies frightened by the skulls in the
    dentists' windows, with their cynical chewing action! It is
    said that a child sat next a dentist's apprentice once in an
    omnibus, and was observed to turn rigid, fixed and white, but
    unable to speak: he had sat on one of these skulls, and it had
    bitten him. Silver-mounted skulls set as goblets, in imitation
    of Byron, are to be seen at any of the china-shops rubbing
    against the chaste cheeks of the old maid's teacup. Skeletons
    are sold, bleached and with gilded hinges, to the medical
    students, who buy the pale horrors as openly as meerschaum
    pipes. Have I not often found young Grandstone supping among
    his doctors' apprentices of the Ober restaurant after
    theatre-hours, a skeleton in the corner filled with umbrellas
    like a hall-rack, and crowned with the triple or quintuple
    tiara of the girls' best bonnets? Ay, Mimi Pinson's cap has
    known what it is to perch on the bony head of Death. The
    juxtaposition is but an emblem. The sewing-girl, like Hood's
    shirtmaker, scarcely fears the 'phantom of grisly bone.' Poor
    Francine! where have you taken <i>your</i> artisanne's cap to,
    I wonder? Are you left alone, all alone again, and thinking of
    the pretty solitude you have left behind you at Carlsruhe? Who
    uses those polished keys now?"</p>

    <p>Hohenfels interrupted me, complaining that my monologue was
    uninteresting and diffuse, and was interfering with the railway
    time-table. But I finished it in the car: "And the railway!
    What has a person of fixed and independent habits to do with
    railways but to growl at them? Before I was tempted upon the
    railway by that impertinent engineer at Noisy, I got up and sat
    down when I liked, ate wholesome food at my own hours, and was
    contented at home. Confusion to him who made me the victim of
    his engineering calculations!
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> Confusion to Grandstone and
       his nest of serpents at &Eacute;pernay! Did they not
       introduce me to Fortnoye, who has doubly destroyed my peace?
       Where are the conspirators, that I may pulverize them with
       my maledictions?"</p>

    <p>This question&mdash;which Hohenfels called peevish as he
    buried himself in his book&mdash;was not answered until we had
    passed Verviers, Chaudfontaine and Li&egrave;ge. I was aroused
    from a sulky slumber in the station at Brussels by Hohenfels,
    who said, in his musical scolding way, like the busy wheeze of
    a clicking music-box, "You may say what you like, with your
    left-handed flatteries, in regard to Fortnoye, and you may
    praise Ariadnes and widows to the end of the chapter. You are
    sorry at this moment not to be at &Eacute;pernay to see the
    destroyer of your peace married: you had rather assist at the
    making of a wife than at the making of a widow."</p>

    <p>I was just sending Fortnoye to the gloomiest shades of
    Acheron when a strong hand entered the carriage-door, helped me
    handsomely down the steps, and then began warmly to shake my
    own. Fortnoye!&mdash;Fortnoye in flesh and blood was before me.
    While my mouth was yet filled with maledictions he began to
    pour out a storm of thanks with all his own particular warmth,
    expressing the most effusive gratitude for the trouble I had
    taken in forsaking my route to be his wife's bridesmaid. That
    is what he called it. "She has but one other," said Fortnoye.
    At the same time I began to recognize other faces not unknown
    to me, crudely illuminated by the raw colors of the
    railway-lights. They all had black wedding-suits and enormous
    buttonhole nosegays of orange-flowers. I picked them out, with
    a particular recognition for each: 'twas the civil engineer of
    Noisy; the short gentleman named Somerard; James Athanasius
    Grandstone, with his saintly aureole upon him in the shape of a
    Yankee wide-awake; the nameless mutes, or rather chorus, of the
    champagne-crypt; in short, my nest of serpents in all its
    integrity. Still entangled with my slumbers, I hesitated to
    respond to the friendly hands that were everywhere thrust
    centripetally toward me.</p>

    <p>I looked blackly at Hohenfels. He was chuckling.</p>

    <p>At Heidelberg, making the acquaintance of M. Fortnoye
    contemporaneously with my departure, he had become more
    enthralled than he ever confessed to this radiant
    traveler&mdash;whom he called a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> packman, but regarded as a
       Mercury&mdash;and his pretty scheme of matrimony in motion.
       Even now, if I can believe my eyes, he goes up to the
       "vintner" and "peddler" of his objurgations, and meekly
       whispers into his ear with the air of a conspirator
       reporting a plot to his chief. Having engaged to produce me
       at the wedding of Fortnoye, and finding me unexpectedly
       recusant, he had adopted a little stratagem for bringing me
       to the scene while thinking to escape from it.</p>

    <p>"Thou too, Brutus!" I said, and gave it up. It only remained
    for me to return all round, after five minutes of petrified
    stupidity, the hand-grasps that had been offered from every
    quarter of the compass-box.</p>

    <p>Next morning, at an early hour, I was interrupted by a
    knock, just as Charles had buttoned my gaiters and the young
    man from the perruquier's (who had stolen in with that air of
    delicacy and of almost literary refinement which belongs to his
    gentle profession) had lathered me. A nick he gave my chin at
    the shock made my countenance all argent and gules, and the
    visitor entering saw me thus emblazoned, while the barber and
    Charles, "like two wild men supporters of a shield," could only
    stare at the untimely apparition.</p>

    <p>"Do you know him, Charles?" I asked, not recognizing my
    guest, and putting over my painted face a mask of wet
    toweling.</p>

    <p>"I know him intimately," replied my jester-in-ordinary: "I
    would thank Monsieur Paul just to tell me his name. Do you
    remember, monsieur, a sort of beggar, with a wagon and a
    stylish horse and a pretty wife, who limped a bit with his
    right hand, or perhaps his left hand? Does monsieur know what I
    mean? He used to come and see us at Passy; and monsieur even
    had some traffic with him in a little matter of two
    chickens."</p>

    <p>"Father Joliet!" I cried.</p>

    <p>"Present!" shouted the personage thus designated at my
    appeal to his name. I turned round, toweled, and he grasped my
    hands. The unusual hour, appropriate as I supposed only to some
    porter or other stipendiary visitor of my hotel, caused to
    shine out with startling refulgence the morning splendors in
    which Papa Joliet had arrayed himself. He wore a courtly dress,
    appropriate to the most formal possible ceremony; his black
    suit was glossy; his hat was glossy; his varnished pumps were
    more than glossy&mdash;they were phosphorescent. Gloves only
    were wanting to his honest hands.</p>

    <p>Soaped, napkined and generally extinguished, I could only
    stammer, "You here in Brussels? What a droll meeting!"</p>

    <p>"Wherefore droll?" asked Joliet, with a huge surprise, which
    lasted him all through his next sentence. "I come here to marry
    my daughter. Everything is ready; we count on your presence at
    the wedding; the lawyer has drawn up the contract; and the
    breakfast is now cooking at the best restaurant in the
    place."</p>

    <p>"Francine's wedding, my dear Joliet!" I exclaimed. And,
    going back to my apprehensions at her furtive disappearance
    from Carlsruhe, and to my conjectures of some amorous mystery
    between her and her Yankee traducer, Kraaniff, I added gravely,
    "It is very
    creditable!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

    <p>"How, creditable&mdash;and droll?" repeated the honest man,
    evidently much surprised at my own accumulating surprises. "Did
    not you hear?"</p>

    <p>"Not the faintest word," I said, "but I am none the less
    gratified to find this affair ending, as it should, in the
    presence of a lawyer. As for your wedding-invitation, my good
    friend, you are a little tardy in delivering it, for it is
    exactly to-day that I am obliged to attend at the marriage of
    one of my friends, M. Fortnoye."</p>

    <p>"Ah, that is a good joke!" cried Joliet, breaking into an
    explosion of laughter and clapping me pleasantly on the
    shoulder&mdash;an action which caused a slight frown on the
    part of Charles. "You always would have your jest, Monsieur the
    American! Tease me and scare me as much as you like: I like
    these hoaxes better before a wedding than after. Hold that," he
    added, extending his hand as if it were a piece of
    merchandise.</p>

    <p>I "held" it, and he went on, dwelling slowly on his words:
    "If you are at Henri Fortnoye's wedding you will be at Francine
    Joliet's also, for both of these persons are to be married at
    one church."</p>

    <p>"Impossible!" I exclaimed, dropping the hand and stepping
    back.</p>

    <p>"What! again?" said Joliet, his manly face visibly
    darkening. "Droll! and creditable! and impossible! Why
    impossible?" Then he dropped his head and looked angrily at the
    floor. "Ah, yes, even you," he said, his eyes still fixed on
    the boards, "believed that a French girl, trained as French
    girls are trained, would flirt and expose herself to remark;
    and all on account of such a man as your compatriot, the other
    American! Well! well! you ought to know your countrymen
    best."</p>

    <p>"I know of no harm," I interposed hastily. "I should always
    have thought Kraaniff hard to swallow as a mere matter of
    taste. I can but recollect, Father Joliet," I went on more
    seriously, "that the last time I met you you begged me not to
    talk of Francine if I would not break your heart. I have to add
    to this the news brought me from Heidelberg, that this Kraaniff
    was a serpent who had fascinated some young girl for an
    approaching meal.&mdash;How dare you, Charles," I cried
    suddenly, recalled to the consciousness of his presence by this
    souvenir of his oratory, "stand here staring? Show the young
    man out directly, and pay him."</p>

    <p>I will not answer for Charles's having got much farther away
    than the door. Joliet continued: "But his aunt knows him now
    for what he is. Kraaniff, say you? I call him Kranich, though
    he had better change his baptismal record than disgrace one of
    the best names in Brussels."</p>

    <p>"Frau Kranich, then, my old friend, is really his aunt?"</p>

    <p>"Madame Kranich, whom I have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> known in your parlor, is
       really Francine's godmother. Did you never know of all her
       secret kindness? That rigid lady would commit a perjury to
       deny one of her own good actions. Young Kranich has written
       her a letter confessing his lies. Don't you know? The very
       same day when you were determined to fight him in a
       duel&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Certainly, certainly," I said, a little confused. "We will
    change the subject and leave my ferocity alone. Let us
    understand one another. In regard to Fortnoye's marriage, was
    there not some talk of a Madame Ashburleigh?"</p>

    <p>"I believe you. Madame Ashburleigh is the very key of the
    manoeuvre. Madame Ashburleigh&mdash;don't you
    perceive?&mdash;lost a child."</p>

    <p>"For that matter, she has lost four. I know the lady
    confidentially, and she told me their histories and present
    address. Lucia lies in Glasgow, Hannibal at Nice, and Waterloo
    sleeps somewhere hereabout, as well as another nameless little
    dear."</p>

    <p>"She is a good woman. She has collected all her proofs, and
    has come hither with them voluntarily&mdash;has perhaps already
    arrived. Brussels, where two of her marmots rest, is one of her
    most frequent stations. That censorious Madame Kranich made a
    scene, but she had to yield to conviction."</p>

    <p>"A censorious Madame Kranich! Is the young duelist
    married?"</p>

    <p>"What? No, no! It is Francine's guardian I speak of. Of late
    years she has become a sort of Puritan abbess, seeking the
    Protestant society which abounds in Belgium, and lamenting her
    husband, whom they say she used to drug with opium."</p>

    <p>"Then is she not Kranich's aunt?"</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, an aunt by marriage; but he is not her nephew: I
    will die before I call him so."</p>

    <p>"Listen," said I, "Father Joliet. You are as full of
    information as an oracle, but you are not coherent. This month
    past I have been hunting down a chimaera, a hydra with a dozen
    heads: each head shows me by turn the portrait of Fortnoye, or
    Francine, or yourself, or Kranich, or Mrs. Ashburleigh. Ever
    since Noisy I have been meandering through the folds of a
    mystery. My head is turning with it. If you want to save me
    from distraction, sit down in this chair and answer me a long
    catechism, without saying a word but in reply to my
    questions."</p>

    <p>"I am sure I talk as plain as a professor. Look! You
    frightened me at first with your doubts and your
    impossibilities. You have only to make Kranich's aunt agree
    with Francine's guardian, and at the same time forgive
    Francine's husband for having assumed the undertaker's bill for
    Madame Ashburleigh's baby."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, my dear Joliet, you are clearer than Euclid." And
    I administered a category of questions. Joliet, with his
    fatherly joy bursting out of him in the longest of parentheses,
    kept quiet in his refulgent shoes and answered as well as he
    could.</p>

    <p>Francine, he protested, had never been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> a flirt (I have met no
       Frenchmen who were ignorant of that one English word, to
       which they give a new value by pronouncing it in a very
       orotund manner, as <i>flort</i>). When she came to be ten or
       twelve, Frau Kranich&mdash;until then a well-preserved
       lioness with an appetite for society&mdash;ceased to give
       her dolls and promised to give her an education. At the same
       time, the banker's widow left Paris, and repaired with her
       charge to Brussels, where the little girl received some good
       half-Jesuitical, half-English schooling, of the kind
       suggested in the Bront&euml; novels. Her diploma attained,
       Francine begged to accompany her English teacher back to
       London: she wished to become a <i>meess</i>, she said, and
       be competent to teach like a new Hypatia. She had hardly
       bidden her kind protectress adieu when Frau Kranich's nephew
       arrived at Brussels, exceedingly dissatisfied with his
       American business in the bar-rooms of the grand duke of
       Mississippi. A sordid jealousy of Mademoiselle Joliet's
       claims upon his aunt took possession of this prudent spirit.
       He took up a watch-post at a university town on the Rhine.
       He began to whisper vague exaggerations of her coquetries
       and liveliness, which the Protestant circle that revolved
       about Madame Kranich did not fail to bear in to her. This
       lady admired her nephew, sure that his want of manners was
       the sign of a noble frankness. She wrote to Francine,
       bidding her come immediately from London. The girl not
       replying, the hopeful nephew was put upon her track. He went
       away. His letters from England reported that Francine was no
       longer in that country, but was probably come back to
       Belgium, "I know not in what suburb of Brussels our very
       independent miss may this instant be hiding," he wrote.</p>

    <p>About the same time, in the circle of French exiles at
    Brussels, a young <i>romantique</i> named Fortnoye was reported
    as weeping and lavishing statues over the grave of an unknown
    infant in the churchyard at Laaken. It was a delicious mystery.
    Kind meddlers approached the sexton, who said that all he knew
    of the babe's mother was that she was a beautiful lady from
    London. Kranich carried the story dutifully to his aunt, adding
    his own ingenious surmise: "Can Francine have become
    sufficiently Anglicised to contract secret marriages with
    roving revolutionists, and scamper about the country with
    ardent young Frenchmen in the style of Gretna Green?" In fact,
    it was really from London that Mrs. Ashburleigh was proceeding,
    for the purpose of taking care, in the Rhenish city where he
    was dying, of her handsome, dissipated, worthless husband.
    Taken suddenly ill at Brussels, she left her infant to the
    unequaled chill of a strange, unknown cemetery, hastening
    thence with tears and despair to the bedside where duty called
    her.</p>

    <p>Has my reader forgotten the dim, tear-swollen story which I
    heard&mdash;not at all improved in the telling&mdash;from my
    generous young friend Grandstone&mdash;how an impulsive
    Frenchman had laid to rest, in flowers and evergreens, the
    unnamed baby of a woman he had never seen? Jealous as I was of
    Fortnoye, I never could think without tenderness of this
    singular action. To make the tomb of this helpless Innocence
    the young man braved the curiosity of his
    comrades&mdash;despised the rumor, the obloquy, and, hardest of
    all, the jests. Well has the wise dramatist decided that
    Ophelia must needs be laid in Yorick's
    bed!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

    <p>Poor Francine, gay, frivolous, innocently vain of her little
    travesty of English behavior, found her accomplishments and
    graces received by her guardian's circle with incomprehensible
    coldness. Hurt and humiliated, she asked to pay a visit to her
    father. The honest rustic received her with a miserable
    confusion of doubt and severity, for her escapade to England
    had never pleased him, and her return from her godmother's home
    wore to him the air of a repudiation. At her father's house,
    however, she was discovered by Fortnoye, who had never heard
    the ingenious Kranich's theory of his own private wedding with
    Francine, and who thought to find in her the veiled unknown of
    the cemetery. He saw for the first time, in the flowery home at
    Noisy, that fresh ingenuous beauty, a little over-cast with
    disappointment. His generous nature was touched; and, with his
    talent for administration and planning, he conceived the idea
    of establishing Francine in the pretty bird's nest at
    Carlsruhe, distant alike from the strongholds of her
    calumniators, Belgium and France.</p>

    <p>Fortnoye now had an object in life. "There is a very young
    person in the cemetery of Laaken who is much in need of a
    chaperone," he said. The frank proofs of his own relations with
    this churchyard would not only do credit to his own reputation,
    but would gratify the best friends of Mademoiselle Joliet and
    at least one other lady. To attain these proofs he had to step
    over the coiling, writhing bodies of a whole nest of rumors.
    When he seized by the throat the especial slander that he
    himself was the husband of the babe's mother, he found written
    on its crest the signature of John Kranich. He sought the aunt.
    This lady gave him several interviews, the Lutheran prayer-book
    for ever in her hand. "Why does the dear girl not come to me?"
    she would say, weeping, but she refused to hear a word against
    her precious nephew, the personification of bluff frankness. As
    if to make crushing him impossible, young Kranich had now
    withdrawn to America, leaving his reputation in that best
    possible protection, the chivalry that is extended toward the
    absent. Fortnoye was baffled. "I will ask the baby at its tomb
    for its mother's and father's name," he cried. In the pretty
    God's Acre he found a fresh harvest of flowers and a new statue
    over the well-known grave. It was a pretty miniature of
    Thorwaldsen's Psyche, on which the proud copyist had inscribed
    his name. A respectful correspondence with Mrs. Ashburleigh, to
    whom he was guided by the sculptor, and who was now taking the
    waters at Wildbad, soon put the whole tangled story to rights.
    Fortnoye had the happiness of conducting Francine, by this time
    his affianced wife, to the good Frau Kranich, who, convinced
    that she had wrongly judged her, threw her arms ardently around
    her recovered jewel, letting the eternal little book fly from
    her hand like a projectile.</p>

    <p>"But the most singular part of the story," concluded Father
    Joliet, "is the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> letter which Fortnoye, after
       two or three quarrels, forced out of young Kranich when the
       latter had returned to Europe, full of triumph and debts, to
       take possession of his aunt for the rest of his life. Here
       it is," added the good man, opening a pocket-book. "The
       hand-writing is drunken, but the sense is clear as
       Seltzer-water. The scholars tell me <i>in vino veritas
       est</i>, but it appears to me that truth really comes out in
       the repentance and headache that follow."</p>

    <p>"MY DEAR AUNT" (ran the letter which Charles had seen forced
    from the alligator after his unlucky game of dominoes): "You
    have known me as the soul of candor. It is this happy quality
    which compels me to state (for I am something of a Rousseau)
    that if I ever playfully accused your pretty pet Francine of
    being a flirt, I knew nothing about it. The best proof is that
    she absolutely refused to join her expectations with mine,
    though I am something of an Adonis. If you believed that she
    and the wine-peddler had made a match, I pity your credulity
    and ignorance of human nature. I am certain that neither the
    peddler nor myself would touch the enterprise until you had
    shown exactly what you would (pecuniarily) do. For my part, I
    have acted throughout on the most exact and advanced scientific
    principles. Intending to modify the spirit-trade in America,
    and especially to introduce the exclusive agency of the Farina
    essences, I found that the sinew particularly needed for this
    leap was capital. Desiring to absorb your bounties toward
    Francine, I at first proposed matrimony. This offer was made
    without any enmity toward the girl, as my next move was without
    affection, though it seems to be resulting to her benefit. I
    became her accuser as coolly as I had been her lover. Passion
    has nothing to do with the combinations of strategic genius: I
    am something of a Washington. My theory of her clandestine
    marriage was one of the most masterly fictions of the
    age&mdash;a plot worthy of Thackeray. If I could have succeeded
    in mutilating the statue in the graveyard, I might have carried
    it, while you would have admired my act of iconoclasm with all
    your Puritan nature. In the momentary abandonment of my plans,
    owing to the machinations of my enemies, you will conceive that
    I am not very rich. My college-debts and other expenses I am
    obliged to leave for your kind attention. The main point of
    this letter, which M. Fortnoye has persuaded me to set down as
    distinctly as in my present feeble state I can, is that
    Francine is a pretty little maid who has never passed by Gretna
    Green. There! that is my <i>credo</i>, and I will subscribe to
    it,</p>

    <p>"Your loving nephew, JOHN.</p>

    <p>"P. S. Address, with such an enclosure as your generosity
    will prompt, JEAN K. FFARINA, sole representative and
    cosmetical chemist in America on behalf of the Farinas of
    Cologne, at New Orleans <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> where I am going to beat my
       adversaries like Old HIC&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At this point the tipsy scrawl became illegible.</p>

    <p>"This is not a very handsome apology. Did Fortnoye accept
    it?" I asked, turning over the clammy and malodorous epistle.
    At this inquiry the crack of the door widened and Charles
    appeared, on fire with enthusiasm, and so possessed with
    self-importance that he forgot the betrayal of his
    indiscretion.</p>

    <p>"I can reply to that question," said Charles. "When M.
    Fortnoye received the paper from the duelist he read it over
    and said, 'You have meant to impose on me, monsieur, with an
    incomplete confession. But, in return for your imperfect
    restoration of Mademoiselle Joliet's portrait, you have
    unconsciously set down such a masterpiece of yourself that I am
    certain your aunt will see you as she never did before.'"</p>

    <p>Charles, having thus added himself to our cabal without
    rebuke, took a lively interest in what followed. The proud
    father continued: "My son-in-law, after some business
    preliminaries, wrote me a handsome letter demanding what he had
    already effectively possessed himself of. I wrote to Francine,
    already returned to her duties, to be a good girl and make her
    husband obey her in all things."</p>

    <p>"That may have been," said I, "what made Francine take to
    laughing all day and all night, as I heard she did some little
    time after my departure from her house. The next news of her,"
    I pursued, "was that she had been spirited away by some sly old
    kidnapper. I almost suspected Kranich."</p>

    <p>"The old kidnapper," said Joliet, laughing heartily at the
    compliment, "is the man now talking to you. I wanted to take
    Francine to her godmother. I turned the key in the door at
    Carlsruhe, set the geographers all upon their travels to
    explore new worlds, and we have been living ever since quite
    close to Madame Kranich, who treats me like an emperor."</p>

    <p>It was easy now to understand why the young Kranich, as soon
    as he could identify me as a protector of Francine, had been
    thrown off his guard and tempted to attack me with his clumsy
    abuse. It was not very mysterious, even, why he had wished all
    handsome girls to be drowned in the Rhine. For him a pretty
    damsel was simply a rival in trade.</p>

    <p>Had I stopped at Wildbad with the party of orpheonists, I
    should have encountered rather sooner the fatal beauties of
    Mary Ashburleigh. It was to meet her that Fortnoye had paused
    at that resort, considering her introduction to Frau Kranich
    almost indispensable to the success of his scheme. She had no
    hesitation in following the protecting angel of her lost child.
    "My object in this journey is a happy marriage," she had told
    me when to my unworthy care her guardianship had been
    transferred. If I timorously suspected the marriage to be her
    own, whose fault was it but mine? My heart leaped up at the
    successive stages of this recital, its hopes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> confirmed by every additional
       fact: the Dark Ladye's hand was certainly free. Fortnoye, I
       should surmise, was not too desirous to abandon this
       magnificent companion at Schwetzingen; but the serpent, he
       knew, was left behind, in company with two or three of his
       and my friends: it was necessary to take the youth by the
       ear, as it were, and dismiss him from the country, without
       loss of time, to his future of counter-jumping. His dueling
       experience may be of some use to him among the bowie-knives
       of Louisiana. If his subsequent path is not strewn with
       roses, let him rejoice that it is at least lubricated with
       cologne-water.</p>

    <p>An hour had passed, and into my room from his own adjoining
    one now ambled amicably my friend the baron. He greeted Joliet
    as an old friend. Many a smoking-match had they had in my
    garden at Marly. But Hohenfels this morning was in robes of
    state, with shoes that shone even beside old Father Joliet's,
    and as a concession to elegance he had abandoned his cavernous
    pipes in favor of cigarettes. A scroll of this description,
    flavored with his Cologne pastille and very badly rolled, was
    trying to exhale itself between his lips.</p>

    <p>"What a genius for conversation you have to-day, my
    Flemming! This hour I have rocked back and forth in bed, trying
    to understand your observations or to cover my ears and go to
    rest. Your tongue has been like the tongue of a monastery-bell
    summoning all hands to penance." But I had hardly spoken ten
    consecutive words. The ears of the baron were this morning
    quite muffled, I think, with the abundance of his hair, which
    he had evidently been dressing with an avalanche of soap and
    water, for the topknot was as harsh and tight as a felt. He had
    lemon-blossoms on his lappel and lemon kids on his fists.</p>

    <p>It was then I remembered that my bags were all in the
    steamer, where I had left them when surprised by Charles's
    indisposition. My tin box would possibly yield me a
    button-nosegay, but otherwise I might beat my breast, like the
    wedding-guest in the <i>Ancient Mariner</i>, for I heard the
    summons and was unable to attend in right attire. "We two must
    take you out in the street and dress you," said Hohenfels.</p>

    <p>Although I had never been dressed in the street, I yielded.
    It was a grand public holiday, and the sounds of festivity,
    which had floated into my chamber with the entrance of
    Hohenfels, were in full cadence outside. Everybody was pouring
    out to the city-gate, or returning from thence, where, in honor
    of some visit from the king of the Belgians and count and
    countess of Flanders, a festival was going on in imitation or
    rehearsal of the grand annual <i>kermesse</i>. These festivals,
    retained in Belgium with a delightful fidelity to the customs
    of antique Brabant, would fit the brush of Teniers better than
    the pen of a mere bewildered tourist. Still, I will try,
    copying principally from the reports of Charles (who contrives
    to peep at everything, with an interest whose amount is in
    ratio with the square of his distance from his master), to give
    a few features of the scene, which he spread in detail before
    the attentive Josephine during many an evening after.</p>

    <p>The principal fair-ground&mdash;though the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> occasion crammed the whole
       city with revelers&mdash;was just outside the gate. It was a
       veritable town in miniature, with a pattern of checker-board
       streets&mdash;Columbine street, Polichinelle street, Avenue
       des Parades, Place des Parades, Street of the Chanson, and
       the like. There were more than five hundred booths, all
       numbered&mdash;shops and restaurants. There were the Salon
       Curtius, the M&eacute;nagerie Bidel, the Bal Mabille, the
       Caf&eacute; Bataclan, the American Tavern. From one of the
       little costumers' shops, Charles&mdash;with a higher
       evincement of antiquarian taste than I should have
       expected&mdash;managed to bear away a pattern of wall-paper,
       which I afterward conferred on Mary Ashburleigh with great
       applause: it was Parisian of 1824, the epoch of Charles Dix,
       and was entirely covered with giraffes in honor of that
       puissant and elegant monarch. The above establishments were
       near the entrance, to the right.</p>

    <p>At the left were more attractions: another menagerie, a heap
    of ostensible gold representing the five milliards paid by
    France, a gallery of astonished wax soldiers representing the
    Franco-Prussian war, a cook-shop with "mythologic"
    confectionery. Farther on, in the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Casti,
    was exposed the "renowned buffoon Peppino," breveted by His
    Majesty the "king of Egypt;" then came the Chiarini Theatre;
    then the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Adrien Delille, an enchantingly
    pretty structure, where receptions were given by a little
    creature who should have sat under a microscope: she was "the
    Princess Felicia, aged thirteen, born at Clotat, near
    Marseilles, weighing three kilogrammes and measuring forty-six
    centim&egrave;tres&mdash;a ravishing figure, admirably
    proportioned in her littleness and <i>tout &agrave; fait
    sympathique!"</i></p>

    <p>The announcements were heard, it was thought by Charles, to
    the very centre of the city. A low-browed animal with rasped
    hair was shouting, "Messieurs and ladies, come and
    see&mdash;come and see the theatre of the galleys! The only one
    in the world! This is the place to view the real instruments of
    torture used on the prisoners&mdash;-chains four yards long and
    balls of thirty-five pounds. All authentic, gentlemen and
    ladies. You will see the poisoners of Marseilles, Grosjon who
    killed his father, Madame Cottin who ate her baby. Come in,
    come in, gentlemen and ladies! Fifteen centimes! 'Tis given
    away! You enter and go out when you like. Come in! It is
    educational: you see vice and crime depicted on the faces of
    the criminals!"</p>

    <p>In another place a malicious Flemish Figaro explained the
    analogy betwen <i>een spinnekop</i> and <i>eene meisie</i>, the
    perspiration streaming over his face; and my ancient
    minnesinger's blood stirred within me at the report of the
    pleasantries which were improvised by this Rabelais of the
    people, and I remembered that I too was a Flemming.</p>

    <p>The bands belonging to the different booths tried to play
    each other down, forming a stupefying charivari, with tributary
    processions that quite overflowed the city. The house of
    "confections" yielded me no broadcloth of a cut or dimension
    suitable to my figure. But my two friends chose me a hat, a
    light pale-tot (my second purchase in that sort on this
    eventful journey), a scented cambric handkerchief, a rosebud,
    and a snowy waistcoat, in which, as in a whited sepulchre, I
    concealed the decay of my toilet. These changes were judged to
    be sufficient for my accoutrement. They might have done very
    well, but on my way back I paused at a lace-shop window to
    inspect some present for Francine. A band, with many banners
    and figures in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> masquerade, swept past,
       followed by a shouting crowd. My friends lost me in a
       moment, and I lost my way. I turned into a street which I
       was sure led to the hotel, gave it up for another, lost that
       in a blind alley, and finally brought up in a steep, narrow
       ca&ntilde;on, where I was forced to ask a direction. The
       passer-by who obliged me was a man bearing a bag of
       charcoal. He answered with a ready intelligence that did
       honor to his heart and his sense of Progressive Geography.
       But he left on my white waistcoat, alas! a charcoal sketch,
       full of chiaroscuro and <i>coloris</i>, representing his
       index-finger surrounded with a sort of cloud-effect. My
       waistcoat had to be given over in favor of the elder garment
       buttoned up in the all-concealing overcoat.</p>

    <p>The ceremonies of the day, I soon found, were to consist in
    an early and informal breakfast at the house of Frau Kranich;
    then the civil wedding at the mayor's office, followed by the
    usual church-service, from which the Protestant godmother of
    Francine begged to be excused; the day to wind up with a
    general dinner at a place of resort outside the city at four
    o'clock, the usual dining-hour in old Brabant.</p>

    <p>The early breakfast gave a renewal of my friendship with
    good Frau Kranich and a glimpse of the bride, with her sweet,
    patient, dewy face shadowed like a honey-drop in the gauzy
    calyx of her artisanne cap; for she was in the simplest of
    morning dresses&mdash;something gray, with a clean white apron.
    The quaint, old-fashioned house where we met was decorated with
    exquisite trifles, the memorials of the mistress's old
    fashionable taste, but scattered over the tables also were
    lecture programmes, hospital reports and photographs of eminent
    philosophers. As I took up for a plaything a gold pen-case,
    well used, which rested on a magnificent old fan, the Kranich
    said, with just a reminiscence of her former vivacity, "You
    find me much changed, Mr. Flemming. I used to be the
    grasshopper in the fable&mdash;now I am the ant."</p>

    <p>"I bless any change, ma'am," said I, "which increases your
    kindness toward this charming girl."</p>

    <p>"Dear Mr. Flemming," said pretty Francine, "how nice and
    shabby you look! You will do admirably to stand by a poor
    girl&mdash;so poor that she has hardly a bridesmaid. I hope you
    are as indigent as you were at Carlsruhe." Upon this I felt
    very fatherly, and clasped her waist from behind as I kissed
    her forehead.</p>

    <p>The lawyer, a professionally bland old man, with a porous
    bald head like an emu's egg, said as he was introduced, "Ah, I
    have heard of you before, monsieur. You are the man of the two
    chickens."</p>

    <p>Joliet was so enchanted with this rare joke, laughing and
    clapping all his nearer neighbors on the back, that I could not
    but accept it graciously. For this exceptional day, at least, I
    must bear my eternal nickname. Was not the maid now present
    whose dower had been hatched by those well-omened fowls? and
    was not the dower now coming to use? Hohenfels paired off with
    the notary, and discussed with that parchment person the music
    of Mozart, and, what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> would have been absurd and
       incredible in any Anglo-Saxon country, the scribe understood
       it!</p>

    <p>Our party had to wait but ten minutes for the groom and his
    men. Fortnoye, in a grand blue suit, with a wondrous dazzle of
    frilling on his broad chest, looked a noble husband, but was
    preoccupied and silent. His chorus supported
    him&mdash;Grandstone, Somerard, my engineer and the
    others&mdash;in dignified black clothes, official
    boutonni&egrave;res and ceremonial cravats: they greeted Frau
    Kranich with awe, and bowed before the polished head of the
    lawyer with the parallelism of ninepins. My little group of
    fellow-travelers was almost complete. The young duelist, of
    course, was not expected or wanted. The Scotch doctor, Somerard
    told me, had been obliged to fly to London, where a mammoth
    meeting of the homoeopathic faith was in progress.</p>

    <p>The great feature of the breakfast came on when every crumb
    of breakfast had been eaten. Charles and the maid cleared away
    the table, and the notary stood up to read the marriage
    contract. The reading, ordinarily a dull affair, was in this
    instance vivified by curious incidents. In the first place,
    Frau Kranich. amending the injustice her over-credulity had
    caused, gave her <i>prot&egrave;g&eacute;e</i> a
    wedding-present of twenty thousand francs, accompanying the
    gift with some singularly tart remarks about her nephew: this
    sum was increased by the groom to sixty thousand. The second
    incident was when Joliet, amid the almost incredulous surprise
    of the whole table, raised the gift, by the addition of ten
    thousand, to seventy thousand francs: the money was the product
    of his former house and garden&mdash;that house of shreds and
    patches which had cost him ten francs. When it came to affixing
    the signatures, the notary appealed to Joliet for his name. He
    could not sign it, being gouty and half forgetful of
    pen-practice, but he responded to the question as bold as a
    lion: "John Thomas Joliet, baron de Rouvi&egrave;re," throwing
    to the lawyer a fine bunch of papers bearing witness to the
    validity of the title; after which he added, no less proudly,
    "wine-merchant, wholesale and retail, at the sign of the Golden
    Chickens, Noisy."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:70%;">
        <a href="images/023.png"
             name="fig023"
             id="fig023"><img width="100%"

             </a>SQUARE OF THE H&Ocirc;TEL DE VILLE, BRUSSELS.
    </div>

    <p>In truth, Joliet's father had rightfully borne the title of
    baron de Rouvi&egrave;re, but, ruined by '48, had abandoned the
    practice of signing it. Joliet resumed it for this special
    occasion, having every warrant for the act, but whispered to me
    that he should never so call himself in future, greatly
    preferring the enumeration of his qualities on his
    business-card.</p>

    <p>Poor Francine meanwhile had looked so timid and blushed so
    that Frau Kranich nodded to her permission of absence. She gave
    one glance at Fortnoye, buried her face in her hands, laughed a
    sweet little gurgle, and fled. When her presence was again
    necessary, she reappeared, drowned in white. We went to the
    mayor's office, where she lost a pretty little surname that had
    always seemed to fit her like a glove; then to the church, an
    obscure one in the neighborhood of Frau Kranich's house. But at
    the door of the sacred edifice the elder lady said, with much
    conciliatory grace in her manner, "I claim exemption from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> witnessing this part of the
       ceremony; and you, Mr. Flemming, must resume or discover
       your Protestantism and enter the carriage with me. I must
       show you a little of the city while these young birds are
       pairing."</p>

    <p>No objection was made to this rather strange proposal. The
    bride, between her father and husband, forgot that she had no
    friend of her own sex to stand near her. We arranged for a
    general meeting at the dinner.</p>

    <p>In the carriage she said, "I brought you away because I am
    devoured with uneasiness. Mrs. Ashburleigh wrote me that she
    would certainly be here for at least the principal part of the
    ceremony. I do not know what to make of it. It may be of no
    use, but we will scour the city. These throngs, this noise,
    make me uneasy. I fear some accident, having," she added with a
    smile, "one lone woman's sympathy for another lone woman."</p>

    <div class="figleft"

    </div>

    <p>I peered through the crowds at this, right and left, with
    inexpressible emotion. Perhaps this accidental sort of quest
    was that which destiny had arranged for the solution of my
    life-problem. To light upon Mary Ashburleigh in these festal
    throngs, perhaps wanting assistance, perhaps calling upon my
    name even now through her velvet lips, was a chance the mere
    notion of which made my blood leap.</p>

    <p>When Brussels gives herself over to holiday-making, she does
    it in a whole-souled and self-consistent way that has plenty of
    attractiveness. The houses seemed to have turned themselves
    inside out to replenish the streets. People in their best
    clothes, equipages, processions, bands, troops of children,
    filled the avenues. Some conjecture that there might have been
    a mistake about the church took us to the cathedral of St.
    Gudule. Here, amid the superb spectrums of the stained windows,
    we searched through the vari-colored throngs that covered the
    floor, but no familiar face looked upon us. Strange to us as
    the old, impassive monumental dukes of Brabant who occupy the
    niches, the people made way to let us pass from the doorway
    between the lofty brace of towers to the high altar, which is a
    juggler's apparatus, and has concealed machinery causing the
    sacred wafer to come down seemingly of its own accord at the
    moment when the priest is about to lift the Host. All was
    unfamiliar and splendid, and we came away, feeling as if our
    own little wedding-group would have been lost in so magnificent
    a tabernacle. The Grande Place, on which lay the wedge-like
    shadow of the high-towered H&ocirc;tel de Ville, was perhaps as
    thronged a honeycomb of buzzing populace as when Alva looked
    out upon it to see the execution of Egmont and Horn. Among all
    the good-natured Netherlandish countenances that paved the
    square there was none that responded to my own.</p>

    <p>We drove vaguely through the principal streets, and then,
    baffled, made our way to the faubourg in which is situated the
    zoological garden, toward which a considerable portion of the
    inhabitants was going even as ourselves. At the entrance our
    carriage encountered that of the bride and groom, and soon the
    whole party of the breakfast-table assembled by the gate, for
    the great coffee-rooms at which our meal was laid were close by
    the garden, and a promenade in this famous living museum was a
    premeditated part of the day's enjoyment. We entered the
    grounds in character, frankly putting forward our claims as a
    wedding-procession. That is the delightful French custom among
    those who are brought up as Francine had been: her father would
    have been heartbroken to have been denied the proud exhibition
    of his joy, and Fortnoye was too great a traveler, too
    cosmopolitan, to object to a little family pageant that he had
    seen equaled or exceeded in publicity in most of the Catholic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> countries on the globe.
       Francine, her artisanne cap for ever lost, her gleaming dark
       hair set, like a Milky Way, with a half wreath of
       orange-blossoms, the silvery gauzes of her protecting veil
       floating back from her forehead, strayed on at the head of
       the little parade. She was wrapped in the delicious reverie
       of the wedding-day. She was not yellow nor meagre, nor
       uglier than herself, as so many brides contrive to be. Her
       air of delicacy and tenderness was a blossom of character,
       not a canker of ill-health. Her color was hardly raised,
       though her head was perpetually bent. Fortnoye, holding her
       on his firm arm, seemed like a man walking through
       enchantments. Just behind, protecting Madame Kranich with an
       action of effusive gallantry that must have been seen to be
       conceived, walked the baron de Rouvi&egrave;re, his brave
       knotted hands, for which he had not found any gloves, busily
       occupied in pointing out the animated rarities that to him
       seemed most worthy of selection. The hilarious hyenas, the
       seals, the polar bears plunging from their lofty rocks, all
       attracted his commendation; and we, who walked behind in
       such order as our friendships or familiarity taught us, were
       perpetually tripping upon his honest figure brought to a
       halt before some object more than usually interesting.
       Exclamations of delight at the bride's beauty, politely
       wrapped in whispers, arose on all sides as we penetrated the
       throng: it was a proud thing to be a part of a procession so
       distinguished. My good Joliet beamed with complacency, and
       drove his little herd up and down and across and about till
       the greater part of the garden was explored. The zoological
       garden of Brussels has the beauty of not showing too
       obviously the character of a prison. It is extensive,
       umbrageous, and the poor captives within its borders have
       enough air and space around their eyes to give them a
       semblance of liberty. For the special feast-day on which we
       visited it the place had been arranged with particular
       adaptation to the character of the time. There were
       elephant-races and rides upon the camels free to all ladies
       who would make the venture. In addition to the zebras, gnus
       and Shetlands, there was that species of race-horse which
       never wins and never spoils a course, being of wood and
       constructed to go round in a tent, and never
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> to arrive anywhere or lose
       any prizes. The pelicans were in high excitement, for all
       along their beautiful little river, where it winds through
       bowery trees, a profusion of living fish had been emptied
       and confined here and there by grated dams, so that the
       awkward birds had opportunity to angle in perfect freedom
       and to their hearts' content. In the more wooded part of the
       garden a mimic hunt had been arranged, and sportsmen in
       correct suits of green, with curly brass horns and baying
       hounds, coursed through the grounds, following a stag which,
       though mangy and asthmatic, may yet have been a descendant
       of the fawn that fed Genevieve of Brabant. We had re-entered
       one of the grand alleys, and were receiving again the little
       tribute of encomiums which the greater privacy of the groves
       had pretermitted&mdash;we were parading happily along,
       conscious of nothing to be ashamed of, our orange-blossoms
       glistening, our veil flying, our broadcloth and
       wedding-favors gleaming&mdash;when we met another group,
       which, though more furtively, bore that matrimonial
       character which distinguished our own.</p>

    <p>At the head walked Mr. Cookson &amp; Jenkinson. He still
    wore that species of shooting-costume which he had made his
    uniform, but it was decked with roses, and his hands were
    encased in milk-white gloves: on his hands, besides the gloves,
    he had the two grammatical ladies from the Rhine steamboat in
    guise of bridesmaids. Behind him walked Mary Ashburleigh. And
    emerging from the skirts of Mary Ashburleigh's dress, with the
    embarrassed happiness of a middle-aged bridegroom,
    was&mdash;no? yes! no, no! but yes&mdash;was Sylvester Berkley.
    I will not expose what I suffered to the curiosity of
    imperfectly sympathetic strangers. I did not faint, and I
    believe men in genuine despair never do so. But I felt that
    weakness and unmanageableness of knee which comes with strong
    mental anguish, and I sank back impotent upon the baron, whose
    lingering legs repudiated the pressure, so that we both
    accumulated miserably upon Grandstone. My eyes closed, and I
    did not hear the Dark Ladye's salutations to Frau Kranich. But
    I awoke to see with anguish a sight that drew involuntary
    applause from all that careless crowd.</p>

    <p>It was the salute of the two brides. Imagine, if you can,
    two great purple pansies, flushed with all the perfumed sap of
    an Eden spring-time, threaded with diamonds of myriad-faceted
    dew,&mdash;imagine them leaning forward on their elastic stems
    until both their soft velvet countenances cling together and
    exchange mutually their caparisons of honeyed gems; then let
    them sway gently back, and balance once more in their morning
    splendor. Such was the effect when these two imperial creatures
    approached each other and imprinted with lips and palms a
    sister's salute. Mary Ashburleigh, whom the throng recognized
    as a natural empress, was arrayed this morning as brides are
    seldom arrayed, but with a sense of artistic obedience to her
    own sumptuous nature and personality. The royal purple of her
    velvets was cut, on skirt and bodice, into one continuous
    fretwork of heavy scrolls and leafage, and through the crevices
    of this textile carving shone the robe she carried beneath: it
    was tawny yellow, for she wore under her outward dress a
    complete robe of ancient lace, whose cobweb softness was more
    than &mdash; only perceived as the slashes of
    her velvets made it evident. It was such dressing as queens
    alone should indulge in perhaps, but Mary Ashburleigh chose for
    once to do justice to her style and her magnificence.</p>

    <p>I was leaning against a tree, stunned in the sick sunshine.
    I heard, while my eyes were closed, a sort of voluminous cloudy
    roll, and the Dark Ladye was beside me. She whispered quickly
    and volubly in my ear, "I tried to confide in you, but I could
    not get it spoken. Yet I managed to confess that my heart had
    been touched. It was only this summer&mdash;at the Molkencur
    over Heidelberg&mdash;he lectured about the ruins. 'Twas
    information&mdash;'twas rapture! I found at once he was the
    Magician. We were quietly united at the embassy this morning.
    And now he can leave that dreadful consulate and has got his
    promotion, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> for he is to be
       <i>charg&eacute;</i> here in Brussels. It is sudden, but we
       were positively afraid to do it in any other way, I am such
       a timid creature. When I saw the travelers' agent on the
       steamboat, I was at first struck with his manly British
       bearing and his resemblance to Sylvester. Then I found he
       had the matrimonial prospectus, and perceived he might be a
       link. He has managed everything beautifully. I had no
       idea&mdash;With his assistance you need no more mind being
       married than going into a shop for a plate of pudding. You
       must come up and be presented, to show you bear no
       malice."</p>

    <p>I cannot tell how I did it, but I allowed Sylvester and the
    agent to grasp my hands, one on either side. Berkley, as to his
    collar, his cravat, his face and his white gloves, presented
    one general surface of mat silver. He clasped me with some
    affection, but his intellect had quite gone, and he said it was
    a fine day.</p>

    <p>I did not rally in the least until after my fourth glass of
    champagne at the dinner. We made one party: indeed, Mrs.
    Ashburleigh had brought her husband hither in that expectation.
    Fortnoye vanished a minute to arrange the banquet-room; and as
    his wife rushed in to find him, followed by the rest of us, he
    snatched a great damask cloth from the table, and there was
    such a set-out of flowers and viands as has seldom been seen in
    Belgium or elsewhere. The table, instead of a cloth, was
    entirely laid with; young emerald vine-leaves: our places were
    marked, and at each plate was a gift for the bride, ostensibly
    coming from the person who sat there, but really provided by
    the forethought of Fortnoye. In front of my own cover two
    pretty downy chicks were pecking in a cottage made of crystal
    slats and heavily thatched with spun glass&mdash;the prettiest
    birdcage in the world. On the eaves was an inscription: "The
    Man of the Two Chickens." It happened that the little keepsake
    I had found for Francine consisted of wheat-ears in pearls and
    gold, adapted for brooch and eardrops; so I only had to drop
    them in beside the chickens and the present was appropriate and
    complete.</p>

    <p>I cannot tell of the effect as Mary Ashburleigh swept into
    that splendid banqueting-room, one long pyramid of velvet
    pierced with webbed interstices of light. If the largest window
    of St. Ursula's church had come down and entered the room, the
    spectacle could not have been so superb. One item struck me:
    the younger bride, of course, wore orange buds; but for the
    Englishwoman, a beauty ripe with many summers, buds and
    blossoms were inappropriate; she wore fruits: in the grand
    coronal of plaits that massed itself upon her head were set,
    like gems, three or four small, delicious, amber-scented
    mandarin oranges. With this piece of exquisite apropos did the
    infallible Mary Ashburleigh crown the edifice of her good
    taste. The two brides sat opposite each other. A small watch,
    which I had happened to buy at Coblenz, I managed to detach and
    lay on the Dark Ladye's plate as my offering. On a card beside
    it I merely wrote, "ANOTHER TIME!"</p>

    <p>Who knows? Perhaps Sylvester may fill and founder as the
    other has done. He looks miserably bilious and frightened.</p>

    <p>I had rather partake of a rare dinner than describe one. The
    wines alone represented all the cellars of the Rhine and the
    whole champagne country. Fortnoye, who gave the feast,
    entertained both Sylvester's party and his own with regal good
    cheer. Think not that Henri Fortnoye was the ordinary
    obfuscated, superfluous, bewildered bridegroom. On the
    contrary, assuming immediately the head of his own table, he
    took the responsibility of the party's merriment, and made the
    good humor flow like the wine. I know not how it was, but ere
    the meal was over I found myself joining in one of his
    choruses; Frau Kranich forgot her asceticism and exhumed all
    her youthful air of gayety; James Athanasius Grandstone
    promised the host to set his wines running in every State of
    America. But the prettiest moment was when the two brides rose
    and touched glasses, mutually and to the health of the company,
    apropos of a little wedding-song which Fortnoye had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> composed and was trolling at
       the head our willing chorus.</p>

    <h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

    <p>I have arrived at Marly, and, with the ssistance of much
    sarcasm from Hohenfels, am getting on with considerable spirit
    at my Progressive Geography. When man's Hope ceases temporarily
    to take a merely Human aspect, may it not suffer a fresh avatar
    and begin in a new and Geographical form its beneficent career?
    The Dark Ladye has sunk beneath my horizon, but speculations
    over the Atlantean and Lunar Mountains are still succulent and
    vivifying.</p>

    </div>

    <p>I fled, lashed by a hundred despairs and by many symptoms of
    headache and dyspepsia, from the wedding-feast at Brussels.
    Charles and the baron of Hohenfels accompanied me. It was a
    night-train. The spectacle of so much wedded happiness was too
    much for me, too much for Hohenfels. The effect was,
    contrarily, rather stimulating to Charles, who has made a match
    with Josephine, and with her assistance is now listening, the
    tear of sensibility in his eye, to Mendelssohn's "Wedding
    March" as executed by the village organ!</p>

    <p>We passed Valenciennes, Somain, Donai, Arras, Amiens,
    Clermont, Criel, Pontoise&mdash;the last points of merely
    bodily travel that I shall ever make: here-after my itineracy
    shall be entirely theoretical. We took a carriage at Pontoise,
    and traversed the woods of Saint-Germain. As I neared home I
    bowed right and left to amicable and smiling neighbors, who
    waved me good-day <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> from their doors. So did my
       Newfoundland, who broke his chain and leaped upon my
       shoulders, flourishing his tail&mdash;overjoyed to salute
       the returning Ulysses.</p>

    <p>In the British Museum, among the Elgin Marbles, Phidias has
    carved a pile of heaped-up marble waves, and out of them rise
    the arms of Hyperion&mdash;the most beautiful arms in the
    world. Homesick for heaven, those weary arms try to free
    themselves of the clinging foam. Another minute and surely the
    triumphant god will leap from his watery couch and guide with
    unerring hands the coursers of the Dawn! But that reluctant
    minute is eternal, and the divinity still remains incapable,
    clogged and wrapped in the embrace of marble waves. Yet the
    real sun every morning succeeds in equipping himself for his
    journey, and arrives, glad, at his welcome bath in the western
    sea.</p>

    <p>The inference I draw is: If you want a career to be eternal
    instead of transitory, hand it over to Art.</p>

    <p>The true moral of it all is, that we are all savage myths of
    the Course of the Sun. We disappear any number of times, but we
    rise and trail new clouds of glory, and our readers or our
    audiences perceive that it is the same old Hyperion back again.

    </div>

    <p>"Ecce Tiberum!" cried the Roman legions when they first
    beheld the Scottish Tay. What power of association could have
    made them see in the clear and shallow stream the likeless of
    their tawny Tiber, with his full-flowing waters sweeping down
    to the sea? Perhaps those soldiers under whose mailed and
    rugged breasts lay so tender a thought of home came from the
    northerly region among the Apennines, where a little bubbling
    mountain-brook is the first form in which the storied Tiber
    greets the light of day. One who has made a pilgrimage from its
    mouth to its source thus describes the spot: "An old man
    undertook to be our guide. By the side of the little stream,
    which here constitutes the first vein of the Tiber, we
    penetrated the wood. It was an immense beech-forest.... The
    trees were almost all great gnarled veterans who had borne the
    snows of many winters: now they stood basking above their
    blackened shadows in the blazing sunshine. The little stream
    tumbled from ledge to ledge of splintered rock, sometimes
    creeping into a hazel thicket, green with long ferns and soft
    moss, and then leaping once more merrily into the sunlight.
    Presently it split into numerous little rills. We followed the
    longest of these. It led us to a carpet of smooth green turf
    amidst an opening in the trees; and there, bubbling out of the
    green sod, embroidered with white strawberry-blossoms, the
    delicate blue of the crane's bill and dwarf willow-herb, a
    copious little stream arose. Here the old man paused, and
    resting upon his staff, raised his age-dimmed eyes, and
    pointing to the gushing water, said, <i>'E questo si chiama il
    Tevere a Roma!'</i> ('And this is called the Tiber at Rome!')
    ... We followed the stream from the spot where it issued out of
    the beech-forest, over barren spurs
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> of the mountains crested with
       fringes of dark pine, down to a lonely and desolate valley,
       shut in by dim and misty blue peaks. Then we entered the
       portals of a solemn wood, with gray trunks of trees
       everywhere around us and impenetrable foliage above our
       heads, the deep silence only broken by fitful songs of
       birds. To this succeeded a blank district of barren shale
       cleft into great gullies by many a wintry torrent. Presently
       we found ourselves at an enormous height above the river, on
       the ledge of a precipice which shot down almost
       perpendicularly on one side to the bed of the stream.... A
       little past this place we came upon a very singular and
       picturesque spot. It was an elevated rock shut within a deep
       dim gorge, about which the river twisted, almost running
       round it. Upon this rock were built a few gloomy-looking
       houses and a quaint, old-world mill. It was reached from the
       hither side by a widely-spanning one-arched bridge. It was
       called Val Savignone."<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       Beyond this, at a small village called Balsciano, the hills
       begin to subside into gentler slopes, which gradually merge
       in the plain at the little town of Pieve San Stefano.</p>

    <p>Thus far the infant stream has no history: its legends and
    chronicles do not begin so early. But a few miles farther, on a
    tiny branch called the Singerna, are the vestiges of what was
    once a place of some importance&mdash;Caprese, where Michael
    Angelo was born exactly four hundred years ago. His father was
    for a twelvemonth governor of this place and Chiusi, five miles
    off (not Lars Porsenna's Clusium, which is to the south, but
    Clusium Novum), and brought his wife with him to inhabit the
    <i>palazzo communale</i>. During his regency the painter of the
    "Last Judgment," the sculptor of "Night and Morning," the
    architect of St. Peter's cupola, first saw the light. Here the
    history of the Tiber begins&mdash;here men first mingled blood
    with its unsullied waves. On another little tributary is
    Anghiara, where in 1440 a terrible battle was fought between
    the Milanese troops, under command of the gallant free-lance
    Piccinino, and the Floren-tines, led by Giovanni Paolo
    (commonly called Giampaolo) Orsini; and a little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> farther, on the main stream,
       Citt&agrave; di Castello recalls the story of a long siege
       which it valiantly sustained against Braccio da Montone,
       surnamed Fortebraccio (Strongarm), another renowned soldier
       of fortune of the fifteenth century.</p>

    </div>

    <p>As the widening flood winds on through the beautiful plain,
    a broad sheet of water on the right spreads for miles to the
    foot of the mountains, whose jutting spurs form many a bay,
    cove and estuary. It was in the small hours of a night of misty
    moonlight that our eyes, stretched wide with the new wonder of
    beholding classic ground, first caught sight of this smooth
    expanse gleaming pallidly amid the dark, blurred outlines of
    the landscape and trees. The monotonous noise and motion of the
    train had put our fellow-travelers to sleep, and when it
    gradually ceased they did not stir. There was no bustle at the
    little station where we stopped; a few drowsy figures stole
    silently by in the dim light, like ghosts on the spectral shore
    of Acheron; the whole scene was strangely unreal, phantasmal.
    "What can it be?" we asked each other under our breaths. "There
    is but one thing that it can be&mdash;Lake Thrasimene." And so
    it was. Often since, both by starlight and daylight, we have
    seen that watery sheet of fatal memories, but it never wore the
    same shadowy yet impressive aspect as on our first
    night-journey from Florence to Rome.</p>

    <p>Not far from here one leaves the train for Perugia, seated
    high on a bluff amid walls and towers. We had been told a good
    deal of the terrors of the way&mdash;how so steep was the
    approach that at a certain point horses give out and carriages
    must be dragged up by oxen. It was with some surprise,
    therefore, that we saw ordinary hotel omnibuses and carriages
    waiting at the station. But we did not allow ourselves to feel
    any false security: by and by we knew the tug must come. We set
    off by a wide, winding road, uphill undoubtedly, but smooth and
    easy: however, this was only the beginning; and as it grew
    steeper and steeper, we waited in trepidation for the moment
    when the heavy beasts should be hitched on to haul us up the
    acclivity. We crawled up safely and slowly between orchards of
    olive trees, which will grow wherever a goat can set its foot:
    beneath us the great fertile vale of Umbria spread like a lake,
    the encircling mountains, which had looked like a close chain
    from <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> below, unlinking themselves
       to reveal gorges and glimpses of other valleys. Thus by
       successive zigzags we mounted the broad turnpike-road, now
       directly under the fortifications, now farther off, until we
       saw them close above us, with the old citadel and the new
       palace. And now surely the worst had come, but the carnage
       turned a sharp corner, showing two more zigzags, forming a
       long acute angle which carried us smoothly to the rocky
       plateau on which the city stands, and we bowled in through
       the old gate-way at a round trot, with the usual cracking of
       whips and rattling and jingling of harness which announces
       the arrival of travelers at minor places on the
       Continent.</p>

    <p>We were not comfortable at Perugia&mdash;and let no one
    think to be so until there is a new hotel on a new
    principle&mdash;but it is a place where one can afford to
    forego creature comforts. Of all the towns on the Tiber, so
    rich in heirlooms of antiquity and art, none can boast such
    various wealth as this. The moment one leaves the centre of the
    town, which is built on a table of rock, the narrow streets
    plunge down on every side like dangerous broken flights of
    stairs: they disappear under deep cavernous arches, so that if
    you are below they seem to lead straight up through the
    darkness to the soft blue heaven, while from above they seem to
    go straight down into deep cellars, but cellars full of
    slanting sunshine. And whether you look up or down, there is
    always a picture in the dark frame against the bright
    background&mdash;a woman in a scarlet kerchief with a
    water-vessel of antique form, or a ragged brown boy leading a
    ragged brown donkey, or a soldier in gay uniform striking a
    light for his pipe. As soon as you leave the live part of the
    town, with the few little <i>caff&egrave;s</i> and shops, and
    the esplanades whence the thrice-lovely landscape unfolds
    beneath your gaze, you wander among quiet little paved
    <i>piazzas</i> with a bit of daisied grass in their midst,
    surrounded by great silent buildings, whence through some
    opening you descry a street which is a ravine, and the opposite
    cliff rising high above you piled close with gray houses
    overhung with shrubs and creepers, and little gardens in their
    crevices like weeds between the stones of a wall; or you come
    out upon a secluded gallery with tall, deserted-looking
    mansions on one hand&mdash;except that at some sunny window
    there is always to be seen a girl's head beside a pot of
    carnations or nasturtiums&mdash;and on the other a parapet over
    which you lean to see the town scrambling up the hillside,
    while a great breadth of valley and hill and snow-covered
    mountain stretches away below.</p>

    <p>Then what historical associations, straggling away across
    three thousand years to when Perugia was one of the thirty
    cities of Etruria, and kept her independence through every
    vicissitude until Augustus starved her out in 40 B.C.! Portions
    of the wall, huge smooth blocks of travertine stone, are the
    work of the vanished Etruscans, and fragments of several
    gateways, with Roman alterations. One is perfect, imbedded in
    the outer wall of the castle: it has a round-headed arch, with
    six pilasters, in the intervals of which are three half-length
    human figures and two horses' heads. On the southern slope of
    the hill, three miles beyond the walls, a number of Etruscan
    tombs were accidentally discovered by a peasant a few years
    ago. The outer entrance alone had suffered, buried under the
    rubbish of two millenniums: the burial-place of the Volumnii
    has been restored externally after ancient Etruscan models, but
    within it has been left untouched. Descending a long flight of
    stone steps, which led into the heart of the hill, we passed
    through a low door formerly closed by a single slab of
    travertine, too ponderous for modern hinges. At first we could
    distinguish nothing in the darkness, but by the uncertain
    flaring of two candles, which the guide waved about
    incessantly, we saw a chamber hewn in the rock, with a roof in
    imitation of beams and rafters, all of solid tufa stone. A low
    stone seat against the wall on each hand and a small hanging
    lamp were all the furniture of this apartment, awful in its
    emptiness and mystery. On every side there were dark openings
    into cells whence came gleams
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> of white, indefinite forms: a
       great Gorgon's head gazed at us from the ceiling, and from
       the walls in every direction started the crested heads and
       necks of sculptured serpents. We entered one by one the nine
       small grotto-like compartments which surround the central
       cavern: the white shapes turned out to be cinerary urns,
       enclosing the ashes of the three thousand years dead
       Volumnii. Urns, as we understand the word, they are not, but
       large caskets, some of them alabaster, on whose lids recline
       male figures draped and garlanded as for a feast: the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span> faces differ so much in
       feature and expression that one can hardly doubt their being
       likenesses: the figures, if erect, would be nearly two feet
       in height. The sides of these little sarcophagi are covered
       with <i>bassi-rilievi</i>, many of them finely executed: the
       subjects are combats and that favorite theme the boar-hunt
       of Kalydon; there was one which represented the sacrifice of
       a child. The Medusa's head, as it is thought to be, recurs
       constantly, treated with extraordinary power: we were
       divided among ourselves whether it was Medusa or an Erinnys
       with winged head. The sphinx appears several times: there
       are four on the corners of an alabaster urn in the shape of
       a temple, exquisite in form and features, and exceedingly
       delicate in workmanship. Bulls' heads, with garlands
       drooping between them, a well-known ornament of antique
       altars, are among the decorations. But far the most
       beautiful objects were the little hanging figures, which
       seemed to have been lamps of a green bronze color, though we
       were assured that they are <i>terra-cotta</i>: they are male
       figures of exquisite grace and beauty, with a lightness and
       airiness commonly given to Mercury; but these had large
       angel pinions on the shoulders, and none on the head or
       feet. There was not a scholar in the party, so we all
       returned unenlightened, but profoundly interested and
       impressed, and with that delightful sense of stimulated
       curiosity which is worth more than all Eurekas. With the
       exception of a few weapons and trinkets, which we saw at the
       museum, this is all that remains of the mighty Etruscans,
       save the shapes of the common red pottery which is spread
       out wholesale in the open space opposite the cathedral on
       market-days&mdash;the most graceful and useful which could
       be devised, and which have not changed their model since
       earlier days than the occupants of those tombs could
       remember.</p>

             PERUGIA.
    </div>

    <p>The conquering Roman has left his sign-manual everywhere,
    but one is so used to him in Italy that the scantier records of
    later ages interest us more here. Like every other old Italian
    town, Perugia had its great family, the Baglioni, who lorded it
    over the place, sometimes harshly and cruelly enough, sometimes
    generously and splendidly&mdash;protectors of popular rights
    and patrons of art and letters. Their mediaeval history is full
    of picturesque incident and dramatic catastrophe: it would make
    a most romantic volume, but a thick one. At length the
    Perugians, master and men, grew too turbulent, and Pope Paul
    III. put them down, and sat upon them, so to speak, by building
    the citadel.</p>

    <p>But time would fail us to tell of the Baglioni, or Pope Paul
    the Borghese, or Fortebraccio, the chivalric <i>condottiere</i>
    who led the Perugians to war against their neighbors of Todi,
    or even the still burning memories of the sack of Perugia by
    command of the present pope. We can no longer turn our thoughts
    from the treasures of art which make Perugia rich above all
    cities of the Tiber, save Rome alone. We cannot tarry before
    the cathedral, noble despite its incompleteness and the
    unsightly alterations of later times, and full of fine
    paintings and matchless wood-carving and wrought metal and
    precious sculptures; nor before the Palazzo Communale, another
    grand Gothic wreck, equally dignified and degraded; nor even
    beside the great fountain erected six hundred years ago by
    Nicolo and Giovanni da Pisa, the chiefs and founders of the
    Tuscan school of sculpture; nor beneath the statue of Pope
    Julius III., which Hawthorne has made known to all; for there
    are a score of churches and palaces, each with its priceless
    Perugino, and drawings and designs by his pupil Raphael in his
    lovely "first manner," which has so much of the Eden-like
    innocence of his master; and the Academy of Fine Arts, where
    one may study the Umbrian school at leisure; and last, but not
    least, the Sala del Cambio, or Hall of Exchange, where Perugino
    may be seen in his glory. It is not a hall of imposing size, so
    that nothing interferes with the impression of the frescoes
    which gaze upon you from every side as you enter. Or no; they
    do not gaze upon you nor return your glance, but look sweetly
    and serenely forth, as if with eyes never bent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> on earthly things. The
       right-hand wall is dedicated to the sibyls and prophets, the
       left to the greatest sages and heroes of antiquity. There is
       something capricious or else enigmatical in the mode of
       presenting many of them&mdash;the dress, attitude and
       general appearance often suggest a very different person
       from the one intended&mdash;but the grace and loveliness of
       some, the dignity and elevation of others, the expression of
       wisdom in this face, of celestial courage in that, the calm
       and purity and beauty of all, give them an indescribable
       charm and potency. At the end of the room facing the door
       are the "Nativity" and "Transfiguration," the latter,
       infinitely beautiful and religious, full of quiet
       concentrated feeling. We were none of us critics: none of us
       had got beyond the stage when the sentiment of a work of art
       is what most affects our enjoyment of it; and we all
       confessed how much more impressive to us was this
       Transfiguration, with its three quiet spectators, than the
       world-famous one at the Vatican. Although there are
       masterpieces of Perugino's in nearly every great European
       collection, I cannot but think one must go to Perugia to
       appreciate fully the limpid clearness, the pensive, tranquil
       suavity, which reigns throughout his pictures in the
       countenances, the landscape, the atmosphere.</p>

    <p>We found it hard to rob Perugia even of a day for a
    pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint Francis at Assisi, yet could
    not leave the neighborhood without making it. We took the
    morning-train for the little excursion, meaning to drive back,
    and crossed the Tiber for the first time on the downward
    journey at Ponte San Giovanni. We got out at the station of
    Santa Maria degli Angeli, so named from the immense church
    built over the cell where Saint Francis lived and died and the
    little chapel where he prayed. The Porzionuncula it was called,
    or "little share," being all that he deemed needful for man's
    abode on earth, and more than needful. It was hither that he
    came in the heyday of youth, forsaking the house of his wealthy
    father, the love of his mother, a life of pleasure with his gay
    companions, and dedicated himself to poverty and preaching the
    word of God. One of our party had said that she considered
    Saint Francis the author of much evil, and as having done
    irreparable harm to the Italian people in sanctifying dirt and
    idleness. But apostles are not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span> to be judged by the abuse of
       their doctrine; and although it cannot be denied that Saint
       Francis encouraged beggary by forbidding his followers to
       possess aught of their own, he enjoined that they should
       labor with their hands for several hours daily. And to me it
       seemed as if out of Palestine there could be no spot of
       greater significance and sacredness to any Christian than
       this, where in a sanguinary and licentious age a young man
       suddenly broke all the bonds of self, and taught in his own
       person humility, renunciation and brotherly love as they had
       hardly been taught since his Master's death. The sternness
       of his personal self-denial is only equaled by his sweetness
       toward all living things: not men alone, but animals, birds,
       fishes, the frogs, the crickets, shared his love, and were
       called brother and sister by him. The great and
       instantaneous movement which he produced in his own time was
       no short-lived blaze of fanaticism, for its results have
       lasted from the twelfth century to our own; and although we
       may well believe that the day is past for serving Christ by
       going barefoot and living on alms, the spirit of Saint
       Francis's doctrine, charity, purity, self-abnegation, might
       do as much for modern men as for those of six hundred years
       ago. Believing all this, we were not sorry that our
       uncompromising friend had stayed behind, and it was in a
       reverent mood that we left the little stone
       chamber&mdash;which shrinks to lowlier proportions by
       contrast with the enormous dome above it&mdash;and turned to
       climb the long hill which leads to the magnificent monument
       which enthusiasm raised over him who in life had coveted so
       humble a home.</p>

    <p>The cliff on which Assisi stands rises abruptly on the side
    toward the Tiber: long lines of triple arches, which look as if
    hewn in the living stone, stretch along its face, one above
    another, like galleries, the great mass of the church and
    convent, with its towers and gables and spire-like cypress
    trees, crowning all. It is this marriage of the building to the
    rock, these lower arcades which rise halfway between the valley
    and the plateau seeking the help of the solid crag to sustain
    the upper ones and the vast superimposed structure, that makes
    the distant sight of Assisi so striking, and almost overwhelms
    you with a sense of its greatness as the winding road brings
    you close below on your way up to the town. It is a triple
    church. The uppermost one, begun two years after the saint's
    death, has a magnificent Gothic west front and high steps
    leading from the piazza, and a rich side-portal with a still
    higher flight leading from a court on a lower level. As we
    entered, the early afternoon sun was streaming in through the
    immense rose-window and flooding the vast nave, illumining the
    blue star-studded vault of the lofty roof and the grand, simple
    frescoes of Cimabue and Giotto on the walls. Thence we
    descended to the second church, in whose darkness our vision
    groped, half blind from the sudden change; but gradually
    through the dusk we began to discern low vaults stretching
    heavily across pillars which look like stunted giants, so short
    are they and so tremendously thick-set, the high altar enclosed
    by an elaborate grating, the little side-chapels like so many
    black cells, and through the gloom a twinkle and glimmer of
    gold and color and motes floating in furtive sunbeams that had
    strayed in through the superb stained glass of the infrequent
    windows. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span> frescoes of Giotto and his
       school enrich every spandril and interspace with their
       simple, serious forms&mdash;no other such place to study the
       art of that early day&mdash;but a Virgin enthroned among
       saints by Lo Spagna, a disciple of Perugino's, made a pure
       light in the obscurity: it had all the master's golden
       transparency, like clear shining after the rain. From this
       most solemn and venerable place we went down to the lowest
       church, the real sepulchre: it was darker than the one we
       had left, totally dark it seemed to me, and contracted,
       although&mdash;it is in the form of a Greek cross&mdash;each
       arm is sixty feet: in fact, it is only a crypt of unusual
       size; and although here were the saint's bones in an urn of
       bronze, we were conscious of a weakening of the impression
       made by the place we had just left. No doubt it is because
       the crypt is of this century, while the other two churches
       are of the thirteenth.</p>

    <p>There are other things to be seen at Assisi; and after
    dining at the little Albergo del Leone, which, like every part
    of the town except the churches, is remarkably clean, my
    companion set out to climb up to the castle, and I wandered
    back to the great church. As I sat idly on the steps a monk
    accosted me, and finding that I had not seen the convent,
    carried me through labyrinthine corridors and galleries, down
    long flights of subterranean stone steps, one after another,
    until I thought we could not be far from the centre of the
    earth, when he suddenly turned aside into a vast cloister with
    high arched openings and led me to one of them. Oh, the beauty,
    the glory, the wonder of the sight! We were halfway down the
    mountain-side, hanging between the blue heaven and the billowy
    Umbrian plain, with its verdure and its azure fusing into tints
    of dreamy softness as they vanished in the deep violet shadows
    of thick-crowding mountains, on whose surfaces and gorges lay
    changing colors of the superbest intensity. Poplars and willows
    showed silvery among the tender green of other deciduous trees
    in their fresh spring foliage and the deep velvet of the
    immortal cypresses and the blossoming shrubs, which looked like
    little puffs of pink and white cloud resting on the bosom of
    the valley. A small, clear mountain-stream wound round the
    headland to join the Tiber, which divides the landscape with
    its bare, pebbly bed. It was almost the same view that one has
    from twenty places in Perugia, but coming out upon it as from
    the bowels of the earth, framed in its huge stone arch, it was
    like opening a window from this world into Paradise.</p>

    <p>Slowly and lingeringly I left the cloister, and panted up
    the many steps back to the piazza to await my companion and the
    carriage which was to take us back to Perugia. The former was
    already there, and in a few minutes a small omnibus came
    clattering down the stony street, and stopping beside us the
    driver informed us that he had come for us. Our surprise and
    wrath broke forth. Hours before we had bespoken a little open
    carriage, and it was this heavy, jarring, jolting vehicle which
    they had sent to drive us ten miles across the hills. The
    driver declared, with truly Italian volubility and command of
    language and gesture, that there was no other means of
    conveyance to be had; that it was excellent, swift, admirable;
    that it was what the signori always went from Assisi to Perugia
    in; that, in fine, we had engaged it, and <i>must</i> take it.
    My companion hesitated, but I had the advantage here, being the
    one who could speak Italian; so I promptly replied that we
    would not go in the omnibus under any circumstances. The whole
    story was then repeated with more adjectives and superlatives,
    and gestures of a form and pathos to make the fortune of a
    tragic actor. I repeated my refusal. He began a third time: I
    sat down on the steps, rested my head on my hand and looked at
    the carvings of the portal. This drove him to frenzy: so long
    as you answer an Italian he gets the better of you; entrench
    yourself in silence and he is impotent. The driver's impotence
    first exploded in fury and threats: at least we should pay for
    the omnibus, for his time, for his trouble; yes, pay the whole
    way to Perugia and back, and his <i>buon' mano</i> besides. All
    the beggars who haunt the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span> sanctuary of their patron had
       gathered about us, and from playing Greek chorus now began
       to give us advice: "Yes, we would do well to go: the only
       carriage in Assisi, and excellent, admirable!" The numbers
       of these vagrants, their officiousness, their fluency, were
       bewildering. "But what are we to do?" asked my anxious
       companion. "Why, if it comes to the worst, walk down to the
       station and take the night-train back." He walked away
       whistling, and I composed myself to a visage of stone and
       turned my eyes to the sculptures once more. Suddenly the
       driver stopped short: there was a minute's pause, and then I
       heard a voice in the softest accents asking for something to
       buy a drink. I turned round&mdash;beside me stood the driver
       hat in hand: "Yes, the signora is right, quite right: I go,
       but she will give me something to get a drink?" I nearly
       laughed, but, biting my lips, I said firmly, "A drink? Yes,
       if it be poison." The effect was astounding: the man uttered
       an ejaculation, crossed himself, mounted his box and drove
       off; the beggars shrank away, stood aloof and exchanged
       awestruck whispers; only a few liquid-eyed little
       ragamuffins continued to turn somersets and stand on their
       heads undismayed.</p>

    <p>Half an hour elapsed: the sun was beginning to descend, when
    the sound of wheels was again heard, and a light wagon with
    four places and a brisk little horse came rattling down the
    street. A pleasant-looking fellow jumped down, took off his hat
    and said he had come to drive us to Perugia. We jumped up
    joyfully, but I asked the price. "Fifty francs"&mdash;a sum
    about equivalent to fifty dollars in those regions. I smiled
    and shook my head: he eagerly assured me that this included his
    <i>buon mano</i> and the cost of the oxen which we should be
    obliged to hire to drag us up some of the hills. I shook my
    head again: he shrugged and turned as if to go. My unhappy
    fellow-traveler started forward: "Give him whatever he asks and
    let us get away." I sat down again on the steps, saying in
    Italian, as if in soliloquy, that we should have to go by the
    train, after all. Then the new-comer cheerfully came back:
    "Well, signora, whatever you please to give." I named half his
    price&mdash;an exorbitant sum, as I well knew&mdash;and in a
    moment more we were skimming along over the hard, smooth
    mountain-roads: we heard no more of those mythical beasts the
    oxen, and in two hours were safe in Perugia.</p>

    <h2>A NIGHT AT COCKHOOLET CASTLE.</h2>

    <h3>I.</h3>

    <p>Cockhoolet was the name of the place: it was a farm of which
    the Ormistons were and had been tenants for several
    generations. A father, mother and five olive-branches made up
    the family. A healthy, happy, united, thriving family they
    were, and as such much respected. There were two sons and three
    daughters, the eldest of whom was Bessie, the "Rose of
    Cockhoolet," as she was called; for that she had all the beauty
    and sweetness of the rose was generally allowed, although there
    were people who could not be made to see this&mdash;people who
    were probably idiopts; not idiots&mdash;although they might
    have a streak of idiocy in them, too, perhaps&mdash;but
    idiopts, or persons who were color-blind. None of the young men
    of the district were color-blind.</p>

    <p>The clergyman of the parish in which Cockhoolet was
    situated, and at whose church the Ormistons attended, was an
    old man comparatively, whose sermons were old-fashioned, and
    not given forth with the fire of youth: he was not one you
    would have expected to be very popular, especially with the
    young; yet various young men from considerable distances were
    attracted to his church, and, generally speaking, they settled
    themselves in pews opposite the gallery in front of which sat
    Mr. Ormiston and his family. Any person who chanced to be in
    the vicinity, if of discerning powers, might have been
    conscious of the electricity in the air. Dull people neither
    saw nor felt it.</p>

    <p>Bessie Ormiston was not dull, but, being a modest girl, she
    would rather not have been stared at; and, being a good girl,
    she thought people might be better employed in church: still,
    she was only a girl, and it would not be the truth to say she
    was mortally offended. Did the person ever exist who was
    offended at an honest compliment? If he ever did, he ought to
    have been fed on sarcasm for the rest of his days.</p>

    <p>Not only was Bessie pretty&mdash;she was also rich. A
    grand-uncle had left her five thousand pounds, her brothers and
    sisters getting only one thousand each. There is no use in
    asking reasons for this: simply, the Rose was born with a
    silver spoon in her mouth. Perhaps, indeed, the old man did not
    know he had so much money, for it was as residuary legatee that
    Bessie got the five thousand pounds, and it was not thought she
    would get anything like that: people remarked, in the language
    of the district, which was apt occasionally to be strong and
    graphic rather than elegant,&mdash;people remarked that "old
    Ormiston had cut up well." Five thousand charms added to those
    Bessie already possessed&mdash;not to mention that her father
    was a rich man&mdash;made her most miraculously charming: like
    Tibby Fowler of the Glen, whose perplexities of this kind have
    been embalmed in song, she had wealth of wooers, and wealth, it
    is well known, makes wit waver.</p>

    <p>It is a saying that an Englishman's house is his castle, but
    the phrase is understood to be figurative: Mr. Ormiston's house
    was his castle without a figure. Cockhoolet Castle is very old,
    at least one part of it is, having been built probably about
    the year 1400. A more modern part was built in 1527, while the
    most modern part of all was added in 1726: this last division
    of it is used as the farm-house. The rooms have been painted
    and papered in the present style of house decoration, and in
    the sitting-rooms, in addition to the little old windows, the
    thick walls have been pierced and a large bow-window put in
    with fine effect. There are three narrow stone staircases
    leading up the three divisions of the castle; there are long
    passages; there are sudden short flights of steps taking you up
    or down into all manner <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> of cornered rooms; there is a
       hall which might hold the population of the county. Keeping
       up one of the spiral staircases, you come out on the roof,
       round which there is a walk guarded by a low stone coping:
       should you want to fling yourself over, you have ample
       opportunity. There are stone sentry-boxes where you can sit
       hidden from the wind and everything else, and look far and
       wide over the country, and down into the garden if you can
       do so without growing giddy. There is also a dungeon
       tenanted by nothing more subject to suffering than potatoes
       and other roots, for which it is a most favorable
       receptable, the walls being so thick and the roof so low
       that cold cannot get in in winter nor heat in summer: there
       is only a single narrow slit in the wall for the admission
       of light, but it is comforting to know that the doomed
       wretches who inhabited it in past ages had at least a
       temperate climate.</p>

    <p>There is the room Queen Mary Stuart slept in when she
    occasionally visited in the vicinity. The reader is perhaps not
    familiar with Queen Mary's name in connection with Cockhoolet
    Castle, but there may be other facts about her of which he is
    also ignorant. Does he know, for instance, that she had a
    daughter by her third marriage, whom, as an infant, she
    despatched to France to be reared in a nunnery, "that she may
    not," said the unhappy queen, "run the risk of having such a
    lot as I have"? Does he know that John Knox was possessed by a
    mad passion of love for Mary Stuart? It has always been thought
    otherwise&mdash;that in point of fact he held her in contempt;
    but as it is proverbial that "nippin' and scartin' (figurative
    of course) is Scotch folks' wooin'," there may be truth in the
    new discovery. But true or not true, it is enough to make the
    bold Reformer blush standing on the top of his pillar in the
    necropolis of Glasgow: perhaps he <i>is</i> blushing, if he
    were near enough to see.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, there is no manner of doubt that Mary
    Stuart honored Cockhoolet Castle by abiding under its roof when
    it suited her to do so. Have not I, the present writer, stood
    in the room she slept in&mdash;looked from the small windows
    set in the ten-foot thick wall from which she looked? Have I
    not gazed over the same country, up to the same skies, into the
    same moon at which she gazed? Could her face be more fair than
    that of the present Rose of Cockhoolet, her thoughts more
    innocent, her reveries more sweet, than those of Bessie
    Ormiston, who in the course of time had succeeded to the room
    which had been consecrated by royal slumbers?</p>

    <p>It is a matter of certainty that Mary Stuart planted a tree
    fast by Cockhoolet Castle&mdash;she would not have been herself
    if she had not done that&mdash;and a magnificent tree it is,
    very old and quite big enough for its age. The queen must have
    been fond of planting trees, and, considering the number she
    planted, it is astonishing how she found time for so many less
    innocent employments: she must have improved each shining hour,
    and, poor woman! she had not too many of these.</p>

    <p>There is a walk also, called the Lady's Walk, leading away
    from the castle up a bosky dell, where a burn amuses itself
    playing at hide-and-seek, but, like a little child, betrays its
    hiding-places by its voice, and comes out into the light again
    and laughs at its own joke. Did the queen ever wander here? did
    she ever "paidle in the burn when summer days were fine"? did
    its murmur ever soothe her ear? did she ever see her fair face
    in its pools, or drop bitter tears to mingle and; flow on with
    its waters?</p>

    <p>The burn has kept trotting through the dell for six thousand
    years, singing its song all the time, and its speed is as good
    and its voice as clear and musical as when the morning stars
    sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Many a
    wild story it could tell if its murmur could be understood; but
    it is a murmur only&mdash;a murmur which crept into the ears of
    C&aelig;sar's legions, of Queen Mary, of Bessie Ormiston, and
    will creep into yours, O reader! if you like to go and explore
    the Lady's Walk, when you can interpret the murmur for
    yourself, as all your predecessors no doubt did. In
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> days of old it fed the moat,
       traces of which are to be seen round the castle still,
       although it has long since been filled up and covered, like
       the park of which it forms part, with rich natural pasture,
       soft, thick and velvety. In short, Cockhoolet had everything
       that a castle ought to have, and wanted nothing that a
       castle ought not to want, not even a ghost.</p>

    <p>It was not the ghost of Mary Stuart: that would have been
    too shocking&mdash;a ghost without a head, or having a head and
    a broad vivid ray of red encircling its neck. Such a ghost
    would have made every one who saw it lose his senses.
    Cockhoolet Castle had a ghost: so much was certain, but
    hitherto no one had ever either seen or heard it. How, then,
    was it certain? Why ask a question like that? Is it reasonable
    to pin a human being down to prove a ghost? Will not
    presumptive evidence do? Strange things had happened, must have
    happened, at the castle: is it for a moment to be supposed that
    these things had happened and all gone scot free?&mdash;in
    other words, that not one of them had left a ghost? It is not
    to be supposed.</p>

    <h3>II.</h3>

    <p>It was Christmas Day. Christmas Day is not solemnized and
    festivalized in Scotland as it is in England; still, the
    observance of it in some shape is creeping in more and more. It
    was Christmas, and Mr. and Mrs. Ormiston had gone to be present
    at a feast from which they were not expected to return till the
    following day. There were left at home the Rose, as head of the
    family for the time being; her sisters, Bell and Jessie,
    supposed to be little girls still, although the supposition
    made them very indignant; and her two brothers, John and
    William. A guest aad two servants made up the known inhabitants
    of the house.</p>

    <p>The guest was a young man who had arrived before the heads
    of the house left, and had been laughingly charged by them to
    see that the children did not work mischief. He was an old
    friend of the family; at least as old a friend as he was a man,
    and she had been in the world a quarter of a century. We shall
    call him Edwin: that name will do as well as another; indeed,
    better, for he might not like his own made public. It need
    hardly be said that among the rest young Edwin loved, and, like
    his namesake in the ballad, he never talked of love. This might
    be stupid, but the stupidity which springs from true modesty is
    not to be classed with the stupidity which springs from want of
    brains, even when, as is quite likely, the consequences are to
    the full as disastrous. Now, how is a young lady to understand
    or bring things to a bearing in a case like this? The Rose
    could not go up to Edwin and tell him she was not a goddess;
    neither could she say, "Although I have five thousand
    pounds&mdash;and you know it, and I know that you know it, and
    you know that I know that you know it&mdash;I am quite ready to
    believe that you love me, and would love me if I hadn't a
    farthing:" she could not say this, but she thought it, she
    worried herself thinking over it, and, being a sensible girl
    with a humble opinion of herself, she came to the conclusion
    that she had been altogether mistaken&mdash;that Edwin did not
    care for her, at least not as she cared for him, otherwise why
    should he not say so? "If," she thought&mdash;"if I were in his
    place and he in mine, neither money nor pride, nor anything
    else, would keep me silent." And the roses in her face deepened
    in color as she thought of her own silly folly in allowing her
    feelings to be drawn in, and she determined her folly should
    cease from that hour; which determination had the effect of
    bringing sharp, short speeches about Edwin's ears tinged with
    sarcasm that were meant to convey to him the conviction that
    she did not care a pin about him; and they answered the purpose
    admirably.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Love is a fickle game, which they</p>

            <p>Whose stakes are deepest worst can play,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Edwin was at Cockhoolet that Christmas Day by the same
    fatality that causes a moth to hover round a brilliant light;
    and when her sister told Bessie that Edwin had come and was
    putting his horse into the stable, she said, "Is Mr. Forrester
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> here again? He must surely be
       dull at home." But of course she received him with friendly
       civility.</p>

    <p>Edwin employed the forenoon out of doors with the boys and
    two other visitors. A Mr. and Mrs. Parker arriving
    unexpectedly, who were anxious to see the castle, the afternoon
    was spent in going through every part of it from dungeon to
    roof.</p>

    <p>Bessie carried the keys: she was ch&acirc;telaine, seneschal
    and cicerone, all rolled in one.</p>

    <p>Going up the narrow stairs, the party had to climb Indian
    file: in the passages they could spread out a little, and in
    some of the rooms in the uninhabited portion they had to walk
    circumspectly, as if they were crossing water on
    stepping-stones, for the flooring was wanting in some places,
    leaving a stretch of bare rafters. Bessie tripped lightly over
    them, and then turned to wait for the others. "Don't be
    frightened," she said: "these rafters are as sound as the day
    they were laid down. The flooring has not rotted: it must have
    been taken up for some purpose. They did not know how to scamp
    work in those days."</p>

    <p>"If we fall through, where shall we go?" inquired Mrs.
    Parker, looking down into what seemed deep mysterious
    darkness.</p>

    <p>"Oh, not very far; but don't fall: it won't be pleasant,"
    said Bessie: "you would alight on very hard stones."</p>

    <p>Mr. Forrester got on the roof first, and handed up the
    ladies; and they all stood looking out over the country. It was
    not a cold, bleak, snowy day, as Christmas in northern
    latitudes has a right to be. The winter had been mild&mdash;one
    of a series of mild winters, overturning the old traditions of
    frosts and snow-storms that lasted for months, and to a great
    extent stopped traffic and labor, and made traveling difficult
    and wearisome. This Christmas was different. The year was dying
    with calmness and dignity, and with a smile on its face, as you
    might take the pale gleam of sunshine to be; and if you were a
    little sad in mood you could suppose there was a wistfulness in
    the smile that was spread over the still, soft face of Nature.
    Cockhoolet stood high, and the country immediately round it was
    flat, and much of it moorland.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>If you climb to our castle's top,</p>

            <p>I don't see where your eye can stop;</p>

            <p>For when you've passed the corn-field country,</p>

            <p>Where vineyards leave off flocks are packed,</p>

            <p>And sheep-range leads to cattle-tract,</p>

            <p>And cattle-tract to open chase,</p>

            <p>And open chase to the very base</p>

            <p>O' the mountain.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Strike out the vineyards and that description will apply
    very well to Cockhoolet; and in addition you ought to have seen
    from its roof Edinburgh and the sea; but on this day the sea
    wore a garment of mist, and had wrapped the metropolis in it
    also, as it not unfrequently does. You ought to have seen more
    than one range of hills too, yet except by eyes well acquainted
    with them their outlines could hardly be distinguished from the
    leaden gray clouds lying in bands along the horizon.</p>

    <p>But as the party stood on the roof the clouds began to rise,
    tower upon tower, against the sky, and the sun, who retires
    early at this season, went behind them, when, instead of the
    pale, wistful gleam he had been keeping up all day, he suddenly
    threw a deep bright golden border on all the edges of the dark
    misty battlements which had piled themselves like castles of
    the Titans: a big rift appearing at their base, there poured
    through it, filling up the space, a great belt of crimson rays
    streaked with gray, as if from burning ashes falling into it,
    and like the dense glow from a furnace, giving the idea that
    the cloud-building was on fire, and that the flames from below,
    shooting up inside the dark walls, were the cause of the
    brilliant illumination that shone round every pinnacle and
    coign of vantage. It was a grand and a curious sight. You could
    fancy the sun looking across to the old Castle of Edinburgh
    standing on its rock, and saying, "Can you do anything like
    this with all the gas and paddelle you can lay your hands on?"
    Precisely this idea struck Mrs. Parker, for she said, "I think
    that is as good a sight as the castle the night the prince was
    married."</p>

    <p>"That was a very good sight in its way," said Mr. Parker,
    "but we can <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> hardly hope to compete with
       the sun, my dear: he has all his materials within himself,
       and we have to pay for them."</p>

    <p>"Do you know, Miss Ormiston," said Mrs. Parker, "one of the
    buildings they said had such a fine effect put me in mind of a
    trunk studded with brass nails&mdash;the initials of the happy
    pair in gas-jets looked like the name of the owner of the
    trunk. All the time I was on the street I could not get that
    notion out of my head; and I was sorry, for I am sure it cost a
    great deal of money to light it up, and I really wished to
    think it grand."</p>

    <p>"We were all in town that night," said John
    Ormiston&mdash;"papa and mamma, and the whole of us, and Mr.
    Forrester, who made eight."</p>

    <p>"I thought it a beautiful sight," said Bessie.</p>

    <p>"I never enjoyed anything more in my life," said Mr.
    Forrester, who on that occasion had been Miss Ormiston's escort
    through the streets, in which they lost their party, and had
    the supreme bliss of wandering together in the crowd, when Mr.
    Forrester almost forgot that Miss Ormiston was a goddess with
    five thousand earthly charms, and Miss Ormiston had compared
    his merits as a guide and protector with those of her brothers,
    and found he was much more considerate, and made her wish law,
    which they were often far from doing. In point of fact, a thaw
    had been very imminent, but, alas! since then a sharp frost had
    set in between them, as unaccountably as frosts frequently do
    set in.</p>

    <p>"I think, now," said Mrs. Parker, "a fine old castle like
    this ought to have had a grander name: don't you think so, Miss
    Ormiston?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, I do, and it had, originally. There was a monastery
    here at one time, over in that field with the trees in the
    corner of it: it was called the abbey of Cakeholy, and when the
    castle was built it got the name of Cakeholy Castle, after the
    abbey. The name Cakeholy, tradition says, arose from the fact
    that an extraordinary saint, whose wants had been relieved at
    the monastery, blessed all the bread that should ever be baked
    there, and the bread ever after had a great sustaining power in
    it; so that pilgrims from Edinburgh and the North, going to the
    southern shrines, all passed this way to get themselves
    supplied with the holy cakes. At the Reformation the abbey was
    destroyed, and became a ruin haunted by owls, so that, partly
    in derision and partly as suiting the altered circumstances,
    the common people corrupted the name into Cockhoolet; and in
    process of time it was given to the castle also, and stuck to
    it. That is the history of a name which is certainly neither
    romantic, nor high-sounding."</p>

    <p>"How interesting!" said Mrs. Parker. "If I were you, I would
    go back to the old name: there is a reverence about it there is
    not about the other. Only think of bands of pilgrims coming
    across the moor there!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, in their gowns and rope girdles, with wallets and
    scallop-shells," said Bessie. "It must have been a curious old
    world then: one could sit here and muse by the hour on all that
    has come and gone. I often bring up my work or my book here in
    summer and think of it."</p>

    <p>"I do like old things," said Mrs. Parker, "and old families
    and old names. Our name, for instance, has no smack of age
    about it, and it is so short and perky: it must have been given
    to some one who had to do with parks."</p>

    <p>"But parks may be a very old institution," said Bessie, "if
    we looked into the thing, though not so old as Forrester: that
    is an ancient name," glancing at Edwin, who was leaning against
    a sentry-box listening and watching the sun putting out the
    lights in his bed-chamber; "yet not nearly so ancient as
    Ormiston. I always feel it is fitting we should live in an old
    castle, we are so ancient ourselves."</p>

    <p>"Are we?" said John: "I never knew that before."</p>

    <p>"Ormiston," she said, "is perhaps as pure a Saxon word as
    now exists. It was during the Roman invasion our ancestor led
    an army through a dense mist against the invaders: just as he
    came up with them the sun shone out and the mist. The legions
    were taken by surprise, for the advancing enemy had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> been hidden by the mist, and
       they were utterly routed. The Saxon king&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What was his name?" asked John.</p>

    <p>"John," she said, "don't seek to be wise above what is
    revealed. The king called our ancestor to the front and made
    him earl of Ormiston on the spot&mdash;'Gold-Mist-on;' that is,
    'Be ever in the van;' and a proud race were the earls of
    Ormiston, and well they answered to the name. But their
    fortunes waned when the modern upstart, the Norman William,
    laid his greedy hands on everything for himself and his mob of
    pirates, and at present we are only middle-class people, but
    our blood must be the bluest of the blue."</p>

    <p>"Mine must be as blue," said Edwin, "for the Forresters came
    in with the trees, and the trees were early settlers."</p>

    <p>"But the mists were first by a very long time," answered
    Bessie.</p>

    <p>"I don't believe that story," said John. "I have read about
    the Cakeholy business somewhere, but you have made that
    Or-Mist-on affair out of your own head: isn't that true,
    Bessie?"</p>

    <p>"I am not bound to answer unbelievers, John."</p>

    <p>"Besides," said John, "Ormiston is far; liker French than
    Saxon."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Parker," said Bessie, "there was an abbot John of
    Cakeholy who flourished in the thirteenth century: his ghost is
    said to revisit its old habitation, or rather the place where
    it stood. I should like to meet it and have a talk over things;
    it would be very interesting."</p>

    <p>"Would you not be terrified?" asked Mrs. Parker.</p>

    <p>"If I saw what I believed to be a ghost, I should die of
    terror," said Bessie; "especially if I was alone and it was the
    dead of night; but I have no faith whatever in ghosts."</p>

    <p>"It is getting rather chilly," said Mrs. Parker.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps we had better go down now, then," Miss Ormiston
    said. "Mr. Forrester, would you come out of your brown study
    and let us pass?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly. I'll see you all safe off the battlements. I
    wasn't in a brown study: I was in a mist."</p>

    <p>"Then take care: people in a mist always think they are
    going the right way when they are going directly wrong."</p>

    <p>"If I only knew the right way!" he said.</p>

    <p>"That's true, Mr. Forrester," said Mrs. Parker. "If we only
    knew the right way; and people tell you to be guided by
    Providence, but I say I never know when it is Providence and
    when it is myself;" and she threaded her way down the narrow
    stairs, followed by the rest of the party.</p>

    <h3>III.</h3>

    <p>The dining-room, with its low roof, its crimson walls, dark
    furniture and handsome fire (the fires at Cockhoolet were
    always handsome: Bessie was the architect and superintended the
    building herself; they never looked harum-scarum nor
    meaningless nor thoughtless, nor as if they were not meant to
    burn; they combined taste, comfort, and, as a consequence,
    economy; everything tasteful and comfortable is in the long run
    economical), its table-cloth, glistening like the summit of the
    Alps and laden with good things, looked a place where people
    even not in love with each other might, unless naturally
    perverse, be very happy.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Parker, being from town, was in raptures with every
    country eatable, especially the scones, which she found were
    manufactured by Miss Ormiston herself.</p>

    <p>"And have they," asked Mr. Parker, "the sustaining power
    that the cakes made here of old had?"</p>

    <p>"If you eat enough of them you may get to Edinburgh to-night
    before you are very hungry," said John.</p>

    <p>"The abbey cakes were unleavened," Bessie explained, "which
    these are not, so that they are less substantial fare."</p>

    <p>"What do you raise them with?" asked Mrs. Parker.</p>

    <p>"Butter, milk and carbonate of soda," said Miss
    Ormiston.</p>

    <p>"We call Bessie a doctor of the Carbon," said John: "she
    makes very good scones, although you would hardly go from here
    to Canterbury on the strength of one of
    them."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>

    <p>"Mr. Forrester, are you dull?" asked Jessie: "you are not
    saying anything."</p>

    <p>"I am too busy eating the holy cakes, Jessie," said Edwin:
    "your sister is a master in her art."</p>

    <p>"I say," Jessie went on, "are you ever dull at home? When I
    told Bessie that you had come she was surprised, and said that
    you must surely be dull at home. I am sorry for you if you are:
    you should come here oftener&mdash;we are never dull here."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," said Edwin, "your sister thinks I come too often,
    as it is."</p>

    <p>Bessie was so deeply engaged pressing Mr. Parker to eat
    strawberry jam, with cheeks the color of the fruit, that of
    course she could not have heard what her sister had been
    saying.</p>

    <p>"Oh no, I don't think she thinks that at all," Jessie said:
    "we never think any one can come too often. Bessie, can Mr.
    Forrester come too often?"</p>

    <p>But still Miss Ormiston was so occupied with Mr. Parker that
    she did not hear.</p>

    <p>And Mrs. Parker said, "It is a most intensely interesting
    old place, this: do not people come to look at it?"</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," replied Bessie, "especially in summer: we
    generally have several parties every week. One of the servants
    takes them over the castle&mdash;grand people often, with
    carriages and livery servants."</p>

    <p>"Do you not keep a book for them to write their names
    in?"</p>

    <p>"No, we have never done that."</p>

    <p>"I would do it if I were you: it would be interesting to
    know who comes and how many. Why, very remarkable people may
    have been here without your knowing."</p>

    <p>"I doubt we are not sufficiently alive to our privileges,"
    Bessie said.</p>

    <p>"It's fine moonlight," said the boys, who, seeing that they
    and every one had ceased eating, were impatient to be out
    again. "Come, Mr. Parker, we'll show you the echo: Mr.
    Forrester, come."</p>

    <p>"I'll go too," said Mrs. Parker; and they all went but the
    Rose, who stayed behind for a little to direct about household
    matters.</p>

    <p>The echo was a favorite with the boys, it gave such
    unlimited scope to their powers of shouting: it was the
    <i>sight</i> they most enjoyed exhibiting to strangers. And it
    was an echo that could repeat every word of a sentence with
    such perfection that it was difficult to believe that it was
    not a human being shouting back from the other side of the
    park, where stood some houses inhabited by the farm-servants
    and their families.</p>

    <p>"Hallo, Abbot John! is that you?" shouted one of the boys,
    and the other cried, "Yes, I'm taking a walk," so quickly that
    the one sentence seemed the answer to the other, and both came
    back loud and distinct on the still night-air.</p>

    <p>"Are the Ormistons ancient? It's all fudge," shouted
    John.</p>

    <p>"Well," said Mr. Parker, "that's the most perfect echo I
    ever heard. I've no doubt the holy fathers of the Middle Ages
    knew of it, and used it in some shape to keep the superstitious
    people in awe."</p>

    <p>"It is awesome," said his wife, "here in the moonlight, with
    the old castle so near: if I were alone, positively I should
    feel eerie."</p>

    <p>"Are you dull at home, Mr. Forrester?" was sent out from the
    depths of Will's chest, and sent back again just as Bessie came
    out and joined the party.</p>

    <p>"Boys! boys!" she said, "don't be foolish."</p>

    <p>"Why, it was what you said yourself," her sister
    remarked.</p>

    <p>"<i>Are</i> you ever dull?" the lad shouted again.</p>

    <p>"Often," answered Edwin, and "Often" came back
    instantly.</p>

    <p>"In that case, Mr. Forrester," said Mrs. Parker, "why don't
    you get a wife? There's no company for a young man like a good
    wife. Here's Miss Ormiston; I don't think you could do
    better."</p>

    <p>Think of the delicate wound of these young people being thus
    openly probed in broad moonlight in the presence of so many
    people! What could Mrs. Parker be thinking of? Not of her own
    love-passages surely, or, if she was, they must have been of a
    blunter order than those of the Rose and her lover.</p>

    <p>"Oh no," said Bessie in cool, indifferent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span> tones: "Mr. Forrester knows
       better than that."</p>

    <p>"There!" said Edwin, "you see, Mrs. Parker, I have been
    refused."</p>

    <p>"'Faint heart never won fair lady,'" said Mrs. Parker.</p>

    <p>The boys hallooed this sentiment to the echo, and the echo
    took it up and sent it back so vigorously that even a timid man
    might have been inspired. "Mary Stuart," "Henry Darnley,"
    "James Bothwell," the lads went on calling to the echo
    alternately&mdash;names which are not mere echoes even after
    three hundred years, but live on by sheer force of tragic
    romance. And it was possible that here, on this very spot, that
    historical trio had stood and laughed and talked and amused
    themselves as the young Ormistons and their visitors were
    doing. What words had they used to rouse the echo? If only it
    could be made to give them back now, what a wonderful echo it
    would be! The world would come to listen to it. Would it tell
    of the passions of love and ambition, grief and hatred, all
    hurrying their victims to their doom? or was the place sacred
    only to gentler memories and softer moods&mdash;the scene of
    enjoyment and freedom from care for however short a time? Who
    can tell?</p>

    <p>There was a woman in the village of Cockhoolet who was
    ninety-eight years old, having all her faculties not perhaps
    quite so fresh as when she was nineteen, but in wonderful
    preservation after having been in daily use for little short of
    a century. She was one of a long-lived race: her father had
    been eighty-nine when he died, and her grandfather ninety-nine.
    Now, it is perfectly possible&mdash;and, as the family had been
    on the spot for centuries, it is even probable&mdash;that her
    great-grandfather might have dug the hole in which Mary planted
    her tree, or he may have saddled the queen's horse when she
    went hunting, or stood by the roadside and lifted his bonnet as
    she and her gay train swept by. Or he may have been despatched
    upon royal errands through the subterranean passage which is
    said to exist all the way between Cockhoolet Castle and
    Edinburgh&mdash;the private telegraph of those days, when wires
    in the air or under the sea by which to send messages would
    have cost the inventors their lives as guilty of witchcraft.
    While shaking hands with this old woman and speaking to her,
    you lost sight of her and the present time and felt the air of
    the sixteenth century blow in your face. Mary came up before
    you in moving habit as she lived&mdash;the young Mary who
    caught all hearts, not heartless herself, and laid hold of mere
    straws to save herself as she drifted desperately with
    circumstances; not the woman who has been painted as an actor
    from first to last, as coming forth draped for effect at the
    very closing scene,&mdash;not that woman, but the girlish queen
    who laughed and called to the echo, and forgot the cares of a
    kingdom while she could.</p>

    <h3>IV.</h3>

    <p>"They are a nice family, those Ormistons," said Mr. Parker
    to his wife as they drove to the railway-station in the
    moonlight.</p>

    <p>"Very," said Mrs. Parker; "and Mr. Forrester is a nice lad.
    I hope he and Miss Ormiston will make it out: I did my best for
    them."</p>

    <p>"They'll be quite able to do the best for themselves: it is
    always better to let things of that kind alone."</p>

    <p>"I don't know that," said Mrs. Parker: "if a little shove is
    all that is needed, it is a pity not to give it."</p>

    <p>"But what if your shove sends people separate? That's not
    what you intended, I fancy?"</p>

    <p>"No fear: people are not so easily separated as all
    that."</p>

    <p>"Well, we have had an uncommonly pleasant visit: I only wish
    the heads of the house had been at home."</p>

    <p>Either the attachment of this pair must have been pretty
    evident to ordinary capacities, or Mrs. Parker must have been
    of a matchmaking turn of mind; probably the latter, for Bessie
    at least was sure that no mortal guessed her secret; which was
    a great comfort to her, seeing that Edwin was so indifferent.
    Alas! there is no rose without a thorn, or if there is it is a
    scentless, useless thing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span> most likely incapable of
       giving either pleasure or pain.</p>

    <p>The Parkers had left early. When the young people went
    in-doors again it was only seven o'clock: the girls proposed a
    game at hide-and-seek, and Bessie seconded the proposal; for
    you see it would have been rather a formidable business to sit
    down and entertain Mr. Forrester all the evening with
    conversation, rational or otherwise; and although at the moment
    she was in the dignified position of lady of the castle, she
    could not the less enjoy a game amazingly.</p>

    <p>The theatre of operations was wisely restricted, because if
    they had gone all over the castle they might have hidden
    themselves so that the game would have been endless; therefore
    they kept to the under part of the inhabited region. At length,
    tiring of this, they changed their game to blindman's buff, and
    went to the kitchen to play it, there being more room and fewer
    obstacles there; besides that, it was empty of tenants at the
    time, the servants having gone to see some of the
    neighbors.</p>

    <p>It was a curious old kitchen, with a very low roof, and
    having a fireplace in a big semicircular stone recess. Many a
    boar's head had revolved there, and many a venison pasty had
    sent forth its fragrance to greet the tired hunters returning
    from the chase. The fire glowed in its deep recess like the eye
    of an old-world monster in a cavern, till one of the boys
    seized the poker and made it flame up, throwing its blaze out
    as far as it could for its walls, and making the kitchen and
    the group standing in it like a picture by Rembrandt.</p>

    <p>"Who's to be blind man first?" cried the girls.</p>

    <p>"Edwin: that will be the best fun," the boys said.</p>

    <p>"Very well, I sha'n't be long blind," said Edwin: "I shall
    soon catch some of you. Who'll tie the handkerchief?"</p>

    <p>"Bessie: she always ties it. Go and kneel to her, and she'll
    tie it so that you won't see."</p>

    <p>What must Mr. Forrester have felt while being blinded by the
    Rose? Only, he had long been accustomed to be if not blinded,
    at least dazed, by her. The boys led him into the middle of the
    floor and dispersed themselves into corners. While he stood in
    the attitude of listening intently, he was conscious of a very
    gentle movement near him, and instantly closed his arms round
    it, as he thought, and encountered empty air, while with a
    shout of laughter the children cried, "Bessie was too quick for
    you. There, quick! quick! Edwin!" He sprang to the corner the
    voices came from, and the boys rushed along the wall to avoid
    his arms spread out to catch them, when suddenly the doorbell
    rang.</p>

    <p>At the sound Edwin put up his hand to take off the
    handkerchief, but the boys cried, "Don't take it off: if it's
    any one, Bessie can speak to them in the dining-room: we don't
    need to stop our game."</p>

    <p>They were not aware that to Mr. Forrester the game without
    Bessie was like <i>Hamlet</i> with the part of Hamlet left
    out.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Bessie, "just go on, and I'll see who is at the
    door." As she left the kitchen she honored Mr. Forrester with a
    good long look: people can feel so much at ease looking at a
    blind person.</p>

    <p>The door was chained for greater security, and Bessie did
    not take off the chain: she merely opened the door as far as it
    would open, but seeing no one, she opened it fully and went out
    on the steps; still she saw no person, although she thought
    whoever rang the bell had not had time to get out of sight.
    Waiting a little without result, she went back to the
    kitchen.</p>

    <p>"Who was it?" cried the children.</p>

    <p>"No one," she said.</p>

    <p>"But the bell rang," said John.</p>

    <p>"Of course it did," Will corroborated.</p>

    <p>"And somebody must have rung it," John said.</p>

    <p>"Some one for a trick, I suppose," Bessie said, "although I
    don't know how he disappeared so fast."</p>

    <p>Without further remark the game was resumed. Edwin had
    caught John, and John had caught Bessie, and when he was
    putting the handkerchief round her eyes Mr. Forrester said,
    "You are making <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> it far too tight, John: you
       are hurting your sister."</p>

    <p>"No fear," said John: "none of us have soft heads here. Is
    it too tight, Bessie?"</p>

    <p>"Rather, but I can bear it: go on."</p>

    <p>"I'll slacken it first," Edwin said.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, that will do. Now move off or I'll catch you."
    She went very vigorously to work, and sent them all flying
    round the kitchen, when the bell rang, and rang loudly,
    again.</p>

    <p>John darted to the door and flung it wide, sure that he
    would see the person who rang it, whether running away or not;
    but there was no one, and the whole party followed him out, and
    they surveyed round and round, but all was still and quiet and
    vacant, the moonlight making it impossible that any figure
    should be there without being seen.</p>

    <p>Now, if you lived in an ordinary house in an ordinary street
    in an ordinary town, an incident like this would create no
    surprise. It happens often: true, it is not a very new or
    bright joke, still it is a joke that boys and girls enjoy, and
    will continue to enjoy. But away in the country, at an old
    castle, with no house within a quarter of a mile of it, the
    case is very different. How was it to be accounted for?</p>

    <p>The Ormistons came in, the girls looking scared, and the
    boys laughing and saying that Mary Stuart or Darnley or
    Bothwell, whose names they had made so free with shouting to
    the echo, must have heard themselves called and were ringing
    the bell, although not allowed to show themselves; but even as
    they said it the boys would fain have whistled to keep their
    courage up.</p>

    <p>"I wish papa and mamma had been at home," said Bell.</p>

    <p>"Or if only the Parkers could have been persuaded to stay
    all night," suggested Jessie.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!" Bessie said. "Some one is playing us a trick,
    but we don't need to let it spoil our game;" and she put the
    handkerchief over her eyes. "Look here, Edwin: will you tie
    this? You do it better than John."</p>

    <p>"He doesn't," said John. "I believe he leaves it so that you
    can see. I'll do it. No, I won't make it too tight."</p>

    <p>"Don't you think, Jessie," Edwin asked, "that I could
    protect you, in case of danger, as well as the Parkers?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know. Perhaps if you were like yourself, but you're
    not like yourself."</p>

    <p>"He's as dull as ditch-water," said John.</p>

    <p>"But," said Jessie, taking his hand with a feeling of
    security, "you're better than nothing&mdash;a great deal better
    than nothing."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Jessie, thank you! A man is the better for a
    little encouragement, you know;" and he looked at the Rose, but
    she was blind; which made her easier looked at, to be sure, but
    there was less chance of an answer, encouraging or
    otherwise.</p>

    <p>They had got up the spirit of the game again, and were going
    on briskly, when they were all brought to a stand by the bell
    ringing for the third time.</p>

    <p>"Don't stop," cried Bessie: "go on with the game and take no
    notice unless it rings again;" and as a leader who must show no
    fear she chased her sisters round the kitchen, making them flee
    to avoid being caught, when, as if in answer to her remark, the
    bell did ring again.</p>

    <p>This was too much. They all ran to the door, but neither
    human being nor ghost was to be seen.</p>

    <p>"I say," said John to his brother, "you and I will go out
    and watch. Edwin, you'll stay with the girls&mdash;they are
    frightened&mdash;and if the bell rings again we'll see who does
    it."</p>

    <p>"You have more need of Edwin than we have, John," Bessie
    said: "it will take you all to catch a ghost."</p>

    <p>"Come away, then," cried John; and he posted his sentinels
    at different angles, where each could have his eye on the door.
    The girls shut themselves in the house, and outside and in they
    awaited the result.</p>

    <p>There was no result.</p>

    <p>Ordinary sentinels can pace to and fro to make the moments
    go more quickly, but Edwin and John and William were compelled
    to stand without speech or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span> motion, as to betray their
       presence would have been to defeat their purpose. At the end
       of half an hour their patience was worn out, and they came
       to the conclusion that whoever was playing the trick knew
       that they were watching; so they went in, and hardly were
       they in and the door shut when the bell rang again.</p>

    <p>John rushed from the kitchen, whither he had gone for
    something, but the others, being in the dining-room and nearer
    the door, reached it before him; and again nothing was to be
    seen but the still calm night, in which hung the moon with all
    her accustomed unimpassioned serenity. What cared she for
    ghosts? Perhaps she is only a ghost herself, else why, with all
    her pale quiet ways, does she never turn round and show herself
    thoroughly? No doubt she has reasons of her own, whether they
    are good or not: her sex is apt to be both capricious and
    persistent&mdash;two qualities which she possesses in
    perfection.</p>

    <p>The Ormistons and Edwin stood out on the broad walk before
    the door, none of them feeling very comfortable, if the truth
    must be told, but none of them showing their feelings except
    Bell and Jessie, who openly declared that they were very much
    frightened.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!" said Bessie. "Who is going to be frightened at a
    silly trick?"</p>

    <p>"But it may be somebody wanting to get in to do us
    harm&mdash;kill us perhaps," suggested Bell.</p>

    <p>"People who want to get into a house for bad ends don't ring
    the front doorbell, or any bell," said Bessie.</p>

    <p>At this junction two figures appeared in the distance
    advancing along the road to the castle&mdash;soon made out to
    be the servants, so that they at least were guiltless in the
    affair.</p>

    <p>"It has not been them, you see," cried John.</p>

    <p>"No," Bessie said, "and you are not to say anything about it
    to them when they come: if they know anything of it, it will
    soon leak out; and if they don't tell, they will be quite
    frightened: they are as easily frightened as Bell or Jessie
    here."</p>

    <h3>V.</h3>

    <p>All this time Mr. Forrester was feeling&mdash;not frightened
    certainly, but&mdash;perplexed; and while he could not but
    admire Miss Ormiston's coolness and courage, he could not help
    wishing that she had been just a little bit chicken-hearted: it
    would have been so delightful to have to act as protector and
    supporter. But there was no opening whatever for such a
    position: she took the mysterious affair into her own hands and
    pooh-poohed it entirely.</p>

    <p>They were accustomed to early hours at Cockhoolet, but when
    the time came for going to bed the girls declared they were too
    frightened to go up stairs alone. "It would be far better,"
    they both said, "for us to stay here all together in this room
    till morning: we could sit up quite well."</p>

    <p>"Absurd!" said Bessie.</p>

    <p>"Well, we could not sleep even if we were in bed," they
    protested.</p>

    <p>"No fear," said the ch&acirc;telaine. "If you were to sit up
    all night you would be like ghosts yourselves to-morrow
    morning. Come, I'll go with you and sit beside you till you
    sleep. But wait a minute till I come back."</p>

    <p>When they were bidding Mr. Forrester good-night he said to
    the girls, "If anything happens let me know."</p>

    <p>"Nothing will happen," said Bessie: "the bell is quiet now
    and the servants are sound asleep. I have just been looking at
    them, and the sooner we follow their example the better."</p>

    <p>"What are we to do if we hear the bell ring again?" John
    asked.</p>

    <p>"Nothing. Keep below the blankets, John," his sister said.
    "It will ring a loud peal indeed if you hear it: I think a
    cannon might be fired at your ear without disturbing you."</p>

    <p>"That's a mistake," said John, "I am a remarkably light
    sleeper: a fly on my nose will make me turn round any
    time."</p>

    <p>"I believe that, but it won't waken you. Good-night;" and
    she took a hand of each of her sisters and went off with all
    the dignity beseeming her position as head of the family and
    governor of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> castle. Her presence being
       withdrawn, Edwin felt much as you do on a March day when the
       sun goes under a cloud, although he had not enjoyed the sun
       either, owing to the undercurrent of east wind that
       continually chilled him. He almost determined to give it up.
       Of what use was it? Evidently she did not care for him, and
       the words, "Mr. Forrester here again! he must surely be dull
       at home," sounded in his ears. Very east-windy they were;
       still, he loved her with a great love, and he could not give
       her up: he was in a mist, and could see neither to go back
       nor forward.</p>

    <p>"I say, Edwin," said John confidentially, "what do you think
    about this bell business? Of course one couldn't speak of it
    before the girls, they are frightened enough
    already&mdash;Bessie too, although she pretends not. What's
    your own private opinion about it?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, it must be a ghost," said Edwin: "they do things of
    that kind, you know&mdash;turn tables and rap and so on. I've
    been thinking I must be an unconscious medium."</p>

    <p>"Well," said John, "I, for one, don't believe in that kind
    of thing: if the spirits ever told anything worth hearing, or
    did anything worth doing, it might be different; but would
    Darnley or Bothwell or the abbot, or even any of the smaller
    fry of monks, come back here to ring a bell? I know in their
    place it's what I wouldn't do myself."</p>

    <p>"It would depend on where they are and how employed," said
    Edwin: "like some other people, they may be dull at home."</p>

    <p>"Ah, that's what Bessie said that's sticking in your throat.
    Man, it's no use minding what girls say: I never do.</p>

    <p>"The spirits must be deplorably dull if ringing a bell is a
    diversion to them."</p>

    <p>"They may enjoy mystifying us," said Edwin. "Who knows but
    they are listening just now, and laughing in whatever they may
    have instead of sleeves?"</p>

    <p>"I'm not frightened," said Will, "but I don't like subjects
    of this kind at bedtime, so I wish you wouldn't say any more
    about it."</p>

    <p>"It seems, however, that the bell was rung by invisible
    agency," said John.</p>

    <p>"Come, come, we'll stop talking and go to bed," Edwin
    said.</p>

    <p>"But, Edwin," said Will with big eyes, out of which he could
    not keep a frightened look, "do you think a spirit did it?"</p>

    <p>"No: it is a trick, and you'll find out who did it before
    long."</p>

    <p>"Well," said John, "it was a stupid trick, but cleverly
    done&mdash;very cleverly done, or whoever did it would not have
    escaped me."</p>

    <p>"I should not like to sleep alone to-night," Will said to
    his brother in confidence when they were in their own room,
    "and I don't believe you would either, although you don't say
    so. I wonder if Edwin likes it, away from every one too, in
    that room with the hole in its roof? I wonder papa does not get
    that hole mended?"</p>

    <p>"He has often spoken about it," said John, "but if I slept
    in that room I should rather like the hole. It's uncommon:
    every room hasn't a hole in its roof. If you couldn't sleep,
    for instance, you'd have only to stare at the hole, and you
    would doze off before you knew."</p>

    <p>"Staring at it would only keep me from sleeping," Will said:
    "I should always think something was looking at me through
    it."</p>

    <p>"What could look at you but light&mdash;moonlight or
    daylight from the room above? In the dark you would the
    hole."</p>

    <p>"Let's sleep," said Will; and, forgetting ghosts and bells
    and all influences, the two boys were soon asleep.</p>

    <p>It is to be hoped the girls were asleep also; indeed, there
    is little doubt the younger ones were. But Bessie, with the
    cares of a castle on her head, the mysteries of the evening to
    perplex her, and an unfortunate love-affair going more and more
    awry, how was it with her?</p>

    <p>And Edwin, in his remote room with its hole in the roof, how
    did he fare? He had gone up a stone staircase, through a long
    passage and down a short flight of steps, into a room large,
    somewhat low in ceiling, and, with the exception
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span> of the hole, most comfortably
       appointed. It felt warm, rather too warm, and he did not
       replenish the fire, preferring to let it go out. The room
       and the way to it were both very familiar to him, and, like
       John, he enjoyed the hole: staring at it made you sleep, and
       when not sleeping your fancy could play round it to any
       extent. On this night the light of the moon, shining in at
       the shutterless windows of the empty room above, fell across
       its floor, and gleamed down through the opening.</p>

    <p>A superstitious person with a talent for being eerie would
    have had nice scope for being frightened out of his senses in a
    situation like this&mdash;alone in a distant room of an old
    castle where bells rang mysteriously, and with borrowed
    moonlight peering down from above like a ghost looking for
    ghosts. But Mr. Forrester was not superstitious&mdash;not in
    the least. He feared nothing material or immaterial
    except&mdash;and it was a curious exception&mdash;except Bessie
    Ormiston; yet it is true he loved her, perfectly as he thought,
    but there was a flaw somewhere: it was not the perfect love
    that casteth out fear. The turning of a straw, however, might
    make it that, but who was to turn the straw? He feared to do
    it, and she would not. Notwithstanding these perturbed and
    cantankerous circumstances, these two people, being young and
    naturally sleepy, slept.</p>

    <p>How long he had been sleeping Edwin did not know, when he
    awoke suddenly, as if he had been startled by some noise.
    However, he might have been dreaming: he did not know. The fire
    was thoroughly out and black, there was no ray of light from
    the roof, and the window-curtains being closely drawn, if there
    was any light outside it was effectually shut out: the room was
    as dark as midnight.</p>

    <p>He rose, and finding his way to the table groped for a box
    of matches that he had noticed lying there, and lighted his
    lamp, when, looking at his watch, he found the hour to be
    half-past three. Before going to bed again he thought he would
    see what night it was. Accordingly, he opened the curtains and
    shutters and gazed forth. The moon had disappeared&mdash;which
    was not remarkable, as it was past her hour for
    retiring&mdash;and the night was very dark and hazy. But a
    remarkable object met his eye. But from an angle of the house,
    and toward the corner of the field which had been the site of
    the ancient monastery, there stood a column five or six feet in
    height of what through the haze appeared luminous vapor. It
    seemed such an altogether unaccountable thing, standing there,
    that Edwin pushed the window open and rubbed his eyes to get a
    better sight of it. He expected it would disappear in some way
    almost immediately, but it did not: there it stood, perfectly
    still and perfectly distinct, at the corner of the field, where
    there was absolutely nothing to cause it. He watched it for a
    considerable time, and as his eye got accustomed to peering
    into the darkness, he could see there was nothing near it, and
    not a sound disturbed the stillness of the night.</p>

    <p>"That's not a trick," he thought: "no one would think it
    worth while to play a trick, certain of being without an
    audience either to see or hear it. I question even if it is the
    abbot himself; or if he likes to air himself there in the
    middle of a winter night, he must be too hot at home, if not
    too dull."</p>

    <p>A filmy mantle of pale white vapor is surely a more likely
    garment for a spirit to snatch up and wrap round him when about
    to indulge in an earthly tour than the conventional and
    traditionary white sheet: in point of fact, for the sheet he
    must wait till he arrives in our world, and when he does arrive
    he must of necessity help himself to it; which I, for one,
    should be sorry to think any well-conditioned ghost would do;
    but light, pale shadowy light, lying about everywhere for the
    picking up, what so suitable as raiment for a being who has
    nothing to wear?</p>

    <p>It could not but occur to Edwin, Had the abbot come back to
    his old haunt on some errand? Had he a benevolent ghostly
    interest in its present inhabitants? Here was a work in which
    even a spirit of mark might engage without loss of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> dignity and with perfect
       propriety. He might turn tables on the perverse
       circumstances that kept two young people separate; and if
       marriages are made in heaven, an angel need not despise such
       a mission as making two lovers happy.</p>

    <p>"Well" thought Edwin, "if you are Abbot John, how do you
    like to see the dear old stones of your monastery built into
    dykes? or would you have preferred seeing them applied to villa
    purposes?" If it were the abbot, Edwin felt he would like to
    have that familiar kind of intercourse with him which in our
    country is known as twa-handed crack; and if it were not the
    abbot, he had a wonderful curiosity to know what it
    was&mdash;to have it accounted for. There it stood, apparently
    as firm and sure as the first moment he had seen it; and a
    cause it must have.</p>

    <p>Accordingly, he dressed himself with the intention of
    proceeding to the spot to interview the abbot and see what kind
    of stuff he was made of. Mr. Forrester took the lamp in his
    hand and opened the room-door softly: not that he thought any
    one would hear him, but soft sounds best become the stillness
    of the night. As he went down the stairs he became conscious of
    a cold air playing about, as if from an open door or window. He
    set his lamp on the stone sill of the passage-window, and had
    his hand on the key of the outer door to unlock it, when he
    heard a quick, sudden scream, apparently from the oldest part
    of the building. He listened intently for a second, but there
    was no repetition of it, and everything was perfectly
    quiet.</p>

    <p>"That was human," he said to himself; and seizing his lamp
    he ran along till he came to the door of the ancient keep,
    which was standing open: he took the way he and the rest of the
    party had gone the previous afternoon, and found the doors that
    were usually kept locked all open. Going on very hurriedly, he
    came to the room where the bare rafters were the only flooring,
    and at the other end of it he saw something like a white heap
    gleaming. He strode across instantly, and stooping with the
    light in hand discovered Bessie Ormiston lying in a dead faint
    just at the edge of one of the rafters: the least movement
    would have sent her down on the hard pavement below. He did not
    stop to think how she came to be there: setting his lamp where
    it would light him across the dangerous flooring, he lifted her
    up and threaded the passages and stairs in the darkness till he
    laid her safe on the dining-room sofa, still unconscious.</p>

    <p>Kneeling beside her in the darkness, he felt that her face
    and hands were very cold. He did not know what to do. If she
    had been any other person, he would have had his senses about
    him, but, being who she was, they had scattered themselves, and
    he felt dazed. The fire was not quite out, and he thought of
    smashing up a chair to make it burn, but searching in the
    coal-scuttle at the side, of the fireplace, he found both
    sticks and coals, and heaped them on: then he lighted the lamp
    that was still standing on the table. All this was the work of
    a minute or two. A fainting-fit was quite beyond the range of
    his experience, but he had some vague idea that in cases of the
    kind water should be dashed in the face or a smelling-bottle
    held to the nostrils or brandy poured down the throat; but none
    of these things were at hand, and as he looked at Bessie,
    hesitating what to do, he saw the color steal back to her face,
    and she opened her eyes and suddenly shut them. When she opened
    them again she took his presence as a matter of course, and
    said, "I sometimes walk in my sleep, I know, but I am not in
    the habit of fainting;" and she smiled, looking much more like
    the lily than the rose.</p>

    <p>"I hope not," he said.</p>

    <p>"It was the fright I got when I woke and saw where I was. I
    shouldn't have been frightened, for I knew the place as well as
    I know this room, and could have found my way back in the
    dark."</p>

    <p>"What can I get for you?&mdash;you must have something." It
    is an awkward thing when a nurse has to seek directions from a
    patient.</p>

    <p>"Nothing," she said: "I can take nothing, and I am quite
    well. I can't think how I was so foolish as to scream, and I am
    sorry for disturbing
    you."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>

    <p>"You did not disturb me: if I had been asleep I should never
    have heard you."</p>

    <p>"I wish you had been asleep."</p>

    <p>"You might have fallen through the rafters and been hurt or
    perished of cold."</p>

    <p>"I shouldn't have fallen through the rafters: I should have
    come to myself and have walked back quite well alone; but I am
    not the less obliged to you."</p>

    <p>"I should say not," he said with a curl of sarcasm. "Then is
    there nothing I can do for you?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing, unless, indeed, you could get hot water for me to
    wash my feet in. Sleeping as I was, I had the good sense to put
    on a thick shawl, but I made my excursion barefoot: they say
    walking barefoot improves one's carriage."</p>

    <p>"Bessie, I never know what to make of you."</p>

    <p>"If you know what to make of yourself it's a great matter:
    sometimes people don't know that," she said, rather
    wearily.</p>

    <p>"I had better make myself scarce at present, probably?" he
    said.</p>

    <p>"I think so."</p>

    <p>"Then good-night. You won't faint again?"</p>

    <p>"No: good-night."</p>

    <p>He left the room and shut the door gently, but when a few
    paces away some impulse moved him to go back: she might faint
    again, and he would ask if he should send one of the servants
    to her.</p>

    <p>When he opened the door she was sitting with her face hidden
    in her hands. At the sound of the door opening she glanced up,
    and Edwin saw tears.</p>

    <p>She turned away instantly. He went up to her and said, "I
    did not mean to intrude. I forgot to ask if I should tell one
    of the servants to come."</p>

    <p>"No, you needn't."</p>

    <p>"Bessie," he said, "you are not well, and something is
    vexing you. Could you not tell me about it. I mean nothing but
    kindness."</p>

    <p>"I know you don't," she said almost fiercely, "and I hate
    kindness: it's an insult."</p>

    <p>He stood in blank astonishment, "An insult?" he said.</p>

    <p>"Yes, an insult; and if you were not obtuse you would see
    it. But you don't see and you don't feel, or you would never
    have tried to make any one care for you for whom you did not
    care a bit. But I won't care for you, and I don't."</p>

    <p>Off her guard, she had been stung into this. She was
    standing away from him, her head erect and her eyes gleaming
    through tears: Mary Stuart herself could not have been more
    effective.</p>

    <p>"Care for you! not care for you!" he said in a voice he
    could hardly control. "I have cared for you as I never cared
    for a thing on earth: I have loved and shall love you as I have
    never loved a human being."</p>

    <p>"How am I to believe it? Why did you not say it? Why did you
    not say it without making me ashamed of myself?"</p>

    <p>"Ashamed! Oh, Bessie, I only feared to annoy you."</p>

    <p>"Annoy!"</p>

    <p>He gathered her to him and kissed her.</p>

    <p>A castle all to themselves at four o'clock in the morning is
    a piece of fortune that rarely falls to lovers, and they need
    not expect it; but those great thick walls were no way taken by
    surprise: they had not been confidants of this kind of thing
    off and on for four or five hundred years to be taken by
    surprise now. Whether after such long familiarity with the old
    story they felt it any way stale, you will readily believe they
    did not say.</p>

    <h3>VI.</h3>

    <p>"I've forgotten the abbot entirely," said Edwin when he had
    time to come to himself after the first draught of miraculous
    champagne. "I was on my way to investigate his ghost when I
    heard an unaccountable scream."</p>

    <p>"I never screamed before, and I don't think I shall ever
    scream again: I don't know how I have been so weak
    to-night."</p>

    <p>"Weakness always draws out kindness," said Edwin.</p>

    <p>"I would rather be weak than obtuse," said Bessie.</p>

    <p>"But it is better to be only obtuse than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> both. I know someone who was
       both."</p>

    <p>Well, what was I to think, and what could I do?"</p>

    <p>"Nothing better than you did&mdash;make a declar&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What were you saying about the abbot's ghost?"</p>

    <p>"I was on my way to have an interview with it
    when&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"What was it like, and where did you find it?"</p>

    <p>"It was like a column of light standing not far from the
    house near the corner of the abbey-field."</p>

    <p>"And you did not think of any explanation of the
    phenomenon?"</p>

    <p>"No, I did not: it seemed more mysterious even than the
    ringing of the bell."</p>

    <p>"To obtuse people it does."</p>

    <p>"I thought the abbot might be feeling without a home, and
    sympathized with him, I assure you, very heartily."</p>

    <p>"I can tell you what it is: the servants had to rise at
    three this morning to work. It is the light shining out from
    the laundry-window: I've seen it often enough."</p>

    <p>"Well, it was a providential ghost for you and Edwin."</p>

    <p>"[illegible]" said John when they were assembled at
    breakfast next morning, looking no worse for the excitement of
    the previous evening, having all slept well: if the bell had
    rung it had disturbed no one at all. Mr. Forrester and Bessie
    had not made any one the wiser of the well-timed appearance of
    the abbot's ghost which had played such an effective part in
    their previous night's drama,&mdash;"I say," he said looking at
    Mr. Forrester and then at Bessie, "there is some understanding
    between you two; you are always looking at each other, and when
    you entered the room this morning you [illegible], and started
    off [illegible] been caught. But I have [illegible] this
    time."</p>

    <p>Bessie realized that her secret had become common property,
    and blushed becomingly.</p>

    <p>Mr. Forrester said, "What have you suspected, John?"</p>

    <p>"That Bessie and you laid your heads together to make the
    bell ring last night to frighten us. Remember, I'm not stupid
    altogether."</p>

    <p>"I assure you, John, I had nothing to do with the ringing of
    the bell," Bessie said.</p>

    <p>"Nor had I," said Edwin.</p>

    <p>"That's queer, then," said John; "but I'm sure there's
    something of some kind between you two: you're planning
    something, I know. What is it?"</p>

    <p>"Wise people don't reveal their plans to every one till near
    the time for executing them, John," said Edwin.</p>

    <p>"Oh, very well," John answered: "you can keep them to
    yourselves. I dare say it's nothing of consequence;" and having
    finished his breakfast, John was off to his out-door business.
    The shortest cut to his destination&mdash;and he always took
    short cuts&mdash;was through the kitchen, and as he hastily
    brushed along the wall toward the door he was brought up
    suddenly by a loud peal of the bell, and he looked at one of
    the servants, who was working at the table, as much as to say,
    "Do you hear that?"</p>

    <p>She answered his look: "Yes, I ha'en, but there's naebody at
    the door. It was yu that rang the bell: ye cam against that bag
    of worsted clues for durning that I hung on the bell-wine
    yesterday. When onybody happens to touch it the weight o' 't
    gars the bell ring; I would hae to ta'en off."</p>

    <p>With this simple and inglorious explanation John rushed to
    the dining-room where he found Mrs. Forrester and the
    ch&acirc;telaine in deep Conspiracy again; and to this hour the
    ghost of Cockhoolet is a matter (if you can use that word in
    connection with a ghost at all) of faith and not of sight.</p>

    <p>When Mrs. and Mrs. Ormiston returned they found that their
    eldest daughter was engaged to be married, which surprised them
    as little as it did the old woman but moved them a good deal
    more.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"

    <h2>THE LEADEN ARROW.</h2>

    <p>A wondrous half-century was that which forms an isthmus
    rather than a bridge between the Middle Ages and the times
    termed Modern. Exit the Last of the Barons&mdash;enter the
    printing-press. Exit Boabdil el Chico&mdash;enter Columbus and
    Da Gama. The plot thickened as the <i>cinquecenti</i> hove in
    view. The last years were the most pregnant. While the last
    sigh of the Moor was dying into the murmurs of the Xenil, that
    solitary shout that will ring while earth lasts went up from
    the bows of the Pinta. Together came America and the sea-way to
    India and&mdash;the rifle. For in 1498, when Buonarotti was at
    his prime, Raphael, fifteen years old, had just taken his seat
    at the paternal easel, and the scenes of the <i>Lusiad</i> were
    in progress, "barrels were first grooved at Venice."</p>

    <p>Who grooved them we are not told. The name of that artist
    has not survived, though we still remember his contemporary
    townsman, Titian. Strictly, he is not entitled to the
    immortality of an originator. That belongs to the unknown
    savage who, in the miocene era probably, first gave a twist to
    the feather of his arrow, thereby communicating to it a
    revolving motion at right angles to the line of flight, and
    making it an "arm of precision." But pre-historic artillery we
    may dismiss or leave to Milton. The blind bard omits to inform
    us whether the guns used in the great pounding-match between
    Lucifer and Michael were smooth-bores or rifles. The strong
    presumption is that they were exclusively the former, and that
    a well-served battery of Parrotts would have silenced them in
    fifteen minutes. By giving him a few pieces of the kind the
    poet would have further brightened the feather he sets in
    Satan's cap as the benefactor of mankind by inventing gunpowder
    and shortening wars. The bow he presents to us as an old and
    familiar weapon even at the date of that first and greatest of
    pitched battles. Its claim, as the parent of projectile
    implements, is recognized in the common etymology of <i>arcus,
    arcualia</i>&mdash;artillery. Arblast, arquebuse, blunderbuss,
    mark a humbler collateral descent in the same verbal family.
    The ballista, or fifty-man-power bow, constituted the heavy,
    and the individual article the light, artillery of twenty
    centuries ago. Slings and javelins, being for hand-to-hand
    fighting (David was near enough to hold an easy conversation
    with Goliath before bringing him down), can hardly be brought
    within the designation. The twang of either heavy or light was
    but a thin contribution to the orchestra of battle compared to
    "the diapason of the cannonade." How much we have lost in the
    absence of this element of tremendous noise from the conflicts
    of ancient days! What a tool it would have been in Homer's
    hands! How trivial, to the author of the book of Job, would
    have seemed the noise of the captains and the shouting! We
    cannot, indeed, quite suppress the fancy that some mightier
    counter-concussion must have filled the air at Thrasimene, when
    "an earthquake reeled unheededly away:" <i>Nemo pugnantium
    senserit</i>, avers Livy. But nothing is said of it. The old
    heroes died in silence, like the wolf "biting hard among the
    dying dogs."</p>

    <p>A well-known essay of a modern poet beautifully uses this
    piece of the modern machinery of his craft. Dryden here makes
    distance mellow the thunder of a naval fight into a musical
    undertone. The great sea-fight between the duke of York and the
    Dutch, fought within hearing of London, left "the town almost
    empty" of its anxious citizens, whose "dreadful suspense would
    not allow them to rest at home," but drew them into the eastern
    fields and suburbs, "all seeking the noise in the depth of
    silence." Dryden and three friends took a barge and descended
    the river. Once clear of the crowded port above Greenwich,
    "they ordered the watermen to let fall their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> oars more gently; and then,
       every one favoring his own curiosity with a strict silence,
       it was not long ere they perceived the air to break about
       them like the noise of distant thunder or of swallows in a
       chimney; those little undulations of sound, though almost
       vanishing before they reached them, yet still seeming to
       retain somewhat of their first horror which they had between
       the fleets. After they had attentively listened till such
       time as the sound by little and little went from them,
       Eugenius, lifting up his head and taking notice of it, was
       the first who congratulated to the rest that happy omen of
       our nation's victory."</p>

    <p>This, the eloquent eolian music of distant and unseen
    battle, was unheard by the ancient cities and their chroniclers
    and poets. It will grow again less familiar as rifled ordnance
    is introduced, with its thinner and sharper style of
    expression. Waterloo appears to have been heard farther than
    Sedan or Metz, although its pieces were but popguns compared
    with those that spoke the requiem of the Third Napoleon. And
    perhaps, if we allow for smallness in number and calibre, those
    employed by Robert the Bruce at the battle of Werewater in
    1327&mdash;said to be the first recorded occasion in
    Europe&mdash;were more vociferous than their successors of
    to-day. Few and cumbrous they must indeed have been, since
    Edward III. could only bring four into the field at
    Cr&eacute;cy; and they did far less service than the twanging
    cloth-yard shaft in deciding the event of that conflict.</p>

    <p>It was not till centuries later that the rifle perceptibly
    exerted its treble voice in the multitudinous debates of the
    <i>ultima ratio</i>. Shrill as John Randolph's, its pipe, once
    set up, was very attentively and respectfully listened to. Like
    his, it spoke from the woods of America. "Stand your ground, my
    brave fellows," shouted Colonel Washington under the sycamores
    of the Monongahela on the 9th of July, 1755, "and draw your
    sights for the honor of old Virginia!" The colonial rifle
    covered the retreat of the British queen's-arm, if retreat such
    a rout as Braddock's could be called.</p>

    <p>It is about the same time that we find a British writer, who
    had witnessed the efficiency of the rifle as a companion
    implement to the axe in pushing European settlement on this
    continent, saying, "Whatever state shall thoroughly comprehend
    the nature and advantages of rifle-pieces, and, having
    facilitated and completed their construction, shall introduce
    into its armies their general use, with a dexterity in the
    management of them, will by this means acquire a superiority
    which will almost equal anything that has been done at any time
    by the particular excellence of any one kind of firearms, and
    will perhaps fall but little short of the wonderful effects
    which histories relate to have been formerly produced by the
    first inventors of firearms."</p>

    <p>This was written in 1748, at which time the rifle was used
    only by the hunters of the Alps and the hunters of the American
    backwoods; the latter having doubtless derived it from the
    former through German immigration. Bull's conservatism,
    however, was in the way. The lessons of Fort Duquesne, of
    Saratoga and of New Orleans were successively wasted on him. He
    did arm one regiment, the Ninety-fifth, with this weapon toward
    the close of the last century, but for a long time it stood
    alone in the royal service. Austria had previously maintained
    some corps of Tyrolese J&auml;gers. The French fought through
    all the wars of their Revolution without having recourse to the
    rifle, save in the campaign of 1793. It is singular that the
    keen eye of Napoleon failed to detect its value, especially
    when we note the use he made of light troops. The fate of
    Nelson justifies the idea that a large body of good riflemen
    might have changed the issue of Trafalgar.</p>

    <p>Curiously enough, the French, who were the last to realize
    the merits of the rifle, were the first to institute those
    improvements which caused, within the present generation, its
    universal substitution for the musket. The Gallic pioneer was
    Delvigne, but his first improvements proved, as Pat might say,
    no improvement at all. The inconvenience of slow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> loading was the most obvious.
       Delvigne's remedy was to give the ball increased windage; in
       other words, to diminish its diameter comparatively with
       that of the bore. The ball thus went easily down to the
       shoulders of the chamber containing the charge. Arrived
       there, a smart rap with the ramrod moulded it to the
       grooves. But it also flattened the top, and forced the
       bottom partly into the chamber. Thus misshapen at birth, the
       bullet was cast upon the world to an erratic and fruitless
       career.</p>

    <p>In 1828 a second Frenchman took the tube in hand. Colonel
    Thouvenin abandoned the chamber, and filled up much of the
    place it had occupied with a cylindrical steel pillar, or
    <i>tige</i>, which projected from the breech-plug
    longitudinally into the barrel. This formed a little anvil
    whereon the bullet was to be beaten into the grooves. But the
    bottom was flattened, and the powder acted only on the
    periphery of the ball instead of the centre, tending thus to
    give it an oblique direction.</p>

    <p>Here Delvigne picked up the weapon for another trial. He
    accomplished far the most important advance yet seen&mdash;an
    advance relatively as great as Watt's separate condenser in the
    steam-engine. He retained the <i>tige</i>, but he <i>changed
    the spherical ball into a cylinder with a conical point</i>, as
    we now have it. In this he, in effect, reached the ultimatum of
    progress as regards the general form of the projectile. He
    assimilated it to Newton's solid of least resistance. That
    primeval missile, the arrow, had for unnumbered centuries
    presented to the eyes of men an illustration of a simple truth
    which scientific formula succeeded, scarce a couple of
    centuries since, in evolving. "The bridge was built," as the
    old sapper told his commander, "before them picters" (the
    engineer's designs) "came." The arrow-head describes, as it
    whirls through the air, a solid varying from a cone only so far
    as its edges vary from straight lines. This variation serves to
    blend the cone with the cylinder formed by the revolution of
    the arrow-head and the feather. The difference in length
    between the ball and the arrow is due to the necessities of the
    case. The least practicable length is best for both. The office
    of the spirally-wound feather in communicating a rotary motion,
    and thereby balancing, by an opposite force, the tendency of
    the missile to swerve in any given direction, is fulfilled by
    the spiral groove of the rifle. Of course, the ordinary smooth
    musket is unfitted to the conico-cylindrical ball. Discharged
    from such a barrel, there being nothing to keep the point in
    the direction of its flight, it soon tumbles over, like an
    arrow without a feather, and strikes wide of the mark.</p>

    <p>Delvigne's new gun came into use in 1840. The long
    matchlocks of the Arabs had been very worrying to the French in
    Algiers. It was a common pastime of the Ishmaelites to pick off
    the Gauls at a distance which left Brown Bess helpless.
    Protruded over an almost inaccessible crag, the former
    primitive instrument would plump its ball into the ranks of the
    Giaour in the dell below with a precision and an effect hardly
    requited by victories in the open field or by the cave-smokings
    of His Grace of Malakoff. Delvigne's arm was accordingly
    supplied to the Chasseurs d'Orl&eacute;ans, and in their hands
    served the desired purpose. The matchlock met its match.</p>

    <p>Under M. Delvigne's system, however, the ball was not always
    well forced into the grooves. The <i>tige</i>, too, made
    cleaning difficult: it often got crooked, and it sometimes
    broke off. A M. Tamisier did something toward removing the
    former difficulty by cutting very shallow grooves on the ball
    itself. The other called forth the ingenuity of the now famous
    Mini&eacute;, who made his first appearance in 1847-1848, and
    whose name has attained the same kind of lethal immortality
    with the names of Shrapnell, Congreve and Rodman. M.
    Mini&eacute; abandoned the <i>tige</i> entirely. He scooped out
    the base of the ball and inserted into it an iron cup. This cup
    was driven into the ball by the explosion, and forced the soft
    lead into the grooves. The leading objection to the
    Mini&eacute; ball in this form was that the device did its work
    too thoroughly. The iron was often driven so deep into the lead
    as to tear off the solid point and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> scatter the whole projectile
       into two or three pieces. This mitrailleuse-like
       distribution of disrupted spheres or leaden asteroids was
       obviated by the abandonment of the iron cup, the powder
       being left to act on the lead itself. Two or three channels
       cut around the neck of the bullet helped to keep the point
       in line, and aided at the same time the fastening of the
       cartridge. Thus came its final metamorphosis to the buzzing
       little torment that has been at intervals for the last
       twenty years flying over all the continents and perplexing
       the nations.</p>

    <p>It was not till 1852 that the Enfield rifle was settled on
    as the standard weapon of the British army. Machinery and
    machinists were imported for its fabrication from the United
    States, the appliances of our government armories being copied,
    and Colonel Bruton, of the Harper's Ferry Works, employed to
    set them going. Prior to that time all firearms of public or
    private manufacture, in England, had been made by hand, the
    interchangeability of all the parts of any given number of guns
    being an end accomplished in this country alone. The advantage
    of having every corresponding detail of each piece a fac simile
    of the same part in all the firelocks of an army must have been
    perceived from the time when such weapons were first invented;
    and nothing but the most inveterate conservatism, or the
    steadiest opposition of that stamp which mobbed
    threshing-machines and the spinning-jenny, could have so long
    staved off its practical adoption.</p>

    <p>Once awakened, however, England became, as she usually does,
    active, innovating and experimental enough. Rifled cannon,
    breech-loaders and armored ships&mdash;all the legitimate
    offspring of the Venetian barrel and its American
    employment&mdash;have kept her ever since in a ferment of
    boards, commissions and target-firing. But these would carry us
    beyond our prescribed limit into a boundless field of inquiry
    and description. It would be like passing from a notice of the
    tubular boiler of Stephenson's Rocket to a discussion of the
    vast railway system it begot.</p>

    <p>The Crimean war afforded the first test, on a large scale,
    in civilized warfare, of the issue between smooth and twist.
    How the conoidal bullet and rifled barrel, opposed at Inkermann
    to the antiquated Russian musket, tore through the dense
    columns which had forced their way to the brow of the plateau,
    driving the stolid Muscovites, "incapable of panic," back into
    the ravine pell-mell&mdash;how, at many periods of the siege of
    Sebastopol, the rifle-pits did more to cripple the defence than
    did the mortars and battering-guns&mdash;we need not recount.
    These pits, and the rope mantlets wherewith they obliged the
    Russians to cover their embrasures, were pronounced by Captain
    (since General) George B. McClellan, in his report of the
    United States Military Commission, about the only marked
    novelties of the siege. Of both, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, he
    and his opponents made effective use in our civil war.</p>

    <p>Nor shall we pick our perilous way among the Sniders,
    Chassepots, Z&uuml;ndnadelgewehre, and
    Z&uuml;ndnadelb&uuml;chsen whose various charms absorb the
    military mind at this day. The debate among them is but as to
    the best utilization of the old arrow-theory. The oblong
    projectile, that goes singing on its winding way, is common to
    them all. Slipped in at the back door or rammed home at the
    front, delicately stirred up by the insinuating needle and its
    titbit of fulminate or bluntly ordered off by the snappish
    percussion-cap, it is the same obedient and faithful messenger,
    and goes on its appointed errand in much the same style.</p>

    <p>Under the ancient r&eacute;gime of the musket it required
    the soldier's weight in lead to kill him. Its point-blank range
    was about sixty yards, but precision even at that short
    distance it by no means possessed. At the battle of Fontenoy
    the English and French Guards, drawn up in opposite lines,
    conversed with each other prior to firing, like two groups of
    friends across the street. "Gentlemen of the French Guards,
    fire!" was the courteous invitation of the British commander.
    "The French Guards never fire first," was the reply. And not
    till then did punctilio come to an end. Such
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> a colloquy in our day would
       need to be carried on with forty-horse power
       speaking-trumpets, or with the thunderous articulation of
       that between the bellowing Alps and echoing Jura. Even
       smooth-bore field-pieces, with point-blank of three hundred
       and twenty yards and service range of one thousand, have to
       keep their distance. It is a rare thing now for cannon to be
       captured by a charge of cavalry or the bayonet. The rifle
       destroys <i>quantum suff.</i> of their horses, and, their
       support overpowered, they remain a helpless prey.</p>

    <p>For this default of the blustering cannon in the trying of
    conclusions with its quiet little cousin, the natural remedy is
    to improve its interior in the same manner. This has been done,
    and with marvelous effect in some respects. But the rifled
    cannon, though extensively used both on sea and land, throwing
    shot and shell five miles, and at close range through iron
    plates a foot thick, cannot be yet styled a perfected weapon.
    It may be in a very few years, thanks to the ardent anxiety, on
    the part of the several peoples composing "the parliament of
    man, the federation of the world," to excel each other in the
    "brain-spattering, windpipe-slitting art." At present it is
    maintained by very good American authority that for use under
    some conditions, at short or moderate range, the smooth gun of
    large calibre is more effective than a rifled gun throwing a
    missile of the same weight. Our monitors continue to be armed
    with the fifteen-inch Rodman, very recent experiments being
    cited to prove its penetrating effect on iron plates greater
    than that of the European rifled guns. This, of course, at very
    close range.</p>

    <p>The rifle is, in its simplest form, a more complex
    instrument than the smooth-bored piece, and will always require
    superior intelligence to manage it. The army which naturally
    possesses this requisite in the highest degree will best handle
    this decisive weapon, and be, other things equal, the strongest
    army. This consideration operates in favor of our people, among
    whom the rifle has always been in so much more constant and
    familiar use than with those of other countries. Our broad
    forests will have to be cleared and our mountain-chains, east
    and west, more densely settled than Switzerland, before the
    distinction of a nation of marksmen can be lost to us. So far,
    there is little evidence of this change. The deer and the
    wild-turkey are nearly as abundant on the Atlantic slope of the
    Alleghanies as they ever were. Probably there are more of both
    in Virginia than at the time of the settlement of Jamestown.
    Like the quail and the bee, they are favored by a certain
    advance of population and cultivation.</p>

    <p>Another species of aborigine does not similarly thrive in
    the path of the rifle. The Indian of the Plains is still
    troublesome occasionally, but far less so than when blue-coats
    and blunderbusses joined forces against him. The odds then were
    often on his side, for many of the red men were armed with the
    rifle, while the troops had but the musket and carbine. The
    appearance of the breech-loading rifle in the hands of the
    United States dragoons on the frontier just fifteen years ago
    let in new light upon the Camanche and Apache mind. Up to that
    period the badgering of a detachment of "heavies" was a
    favorite pastime with these gentry. They got up their "spring
    fights" with as much coolness and regularity as the early
    patriarchs of Texas are related to have done, and not merely,
    as in the case of the latter, in utter contempt, but directly
    at the expense, of the constituted authorities. Tying a bag of
    dried mule-meat and pounded corn to the peak of his saddle,
    fashioning a small supply of arrows, or balls if he boasted the
    spectre of a gun, coloring the inferior half of his
    frontispiece a rich vermilion and the upper a delicate green,
    with ramifications of lampblack coursing tastefully along the
    cheek-bones and the bridge of the nose, twisting a crane's
    feather into the tail of his horse, and giving his affectionate
    squaw a farewell kick, the cavalier of the prairie was ready
    for a raid on the Long-knives. Making a rapid night-march or
    two, he would carry the "latest intelligence from the Indian
    country" to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> border ranches of Texas or
       New Mexico. Stampeding all the horses and mules that stood
       or ranged convenient, and under favorable circumstances some
       cattle and sheep, and "gobbling" on occasion some incautious
       Cyrion or Phyllis of the Western Arcadia, the marauder made
       for the mountains. By the time he had well passed the last
       outpost the hue-and-cry was at his heels, followed, after an
       easy-going delay, by the lumbering dragoon. The soldier,
       armed with ineffectual sabre and carbine, encumbered with a
       variety of traps about as useful as they, usually managed,
       if not forced to put back by stress of provisions, to come
       up with him in the gates of the hills. There an idle
       interchange of arrow and round ball between hollow and cliff
       wound up the eventful history of the chase. As a rule, no
       marked chastisement was inflicted on the Indian: he realized
       in peace the proceeds of his little speculation.</p>

    <p>Now, Mini&eacute;, like the Harpagon of his countryman, has
    "changed all that." The retreating heathen flies to his hills
    in vain. They do not cover him, but the rifle does. Cantering
    to the summit of a knoll, he waves his compliments to the
    distant dragoon with a gesture of derision, more expressive
    than elegant, he has acquired from the white. Turning calmly to
    depart, as he sinks below the crest of the hill a sagittiform
    bullet, fired at five hundred yards' distance with all the
    science and talent purchasable with thirteen dollars a month
    and rations, plumps into the rump of his unhappy pony, and the
    Stoic of the woods is unhorsed. Reared on horseback, and weak
    in the legs from long addiction to that mode of locomotion,
    this is a <i>casus omissus</i> in Lo's tactics. Scant time,
    however, has he for reflection. He gathers up himself and his
    drapery as well as circumstances will allow, and scuttles
    hurriedly off, a fluttering chaos of rags and feathers. It is
    too late. Heaven is on the side of the best artillery. A few
    minutes and the Philistines are upon him. Burnside's or
    Remington's last patent again lifts up its voice, and the
    triumph of civilization is complete.</p>

    <p>The prairie Indian, unlike his congener of the woods, has as
    yet been but partially able to substitute gunpowder for the
    bow. The advantage he has in the protection afforded him by the
    desolation of his waterless <i>mesas</i> and sage-covered hills
    is thus in great measure neutralized. What, when he does
    possess the modern firearm, he is capable of doing with it, the
    achievements of the Modocs in their volcanic stronghold will
    attest. But these were few, and soon went down. The extinction
    of the tribes west and south of the Rio Grande and the Humboldt
    cannot be many years postponed. The red rover of that region
    will disappear as a combatant in the same way, and before the
    same weapon, as his brother nomad of Algeria, the earliest
    victim of the conoidal bullet. The spherical ball has done its
    appointed part in disposing of the aborigines east of the
    Mississippi, where forests covered the land and trees generally
    intercepted the sight at a hundred or a hundred and fifty
    yards. With the extension of Caucasian empire to the Plains
    came an extension of the range of vision, which necessitated an
    advance in the range of the rifle. The weapon of Sharpe figured
    for the first time in the van when the woods of Missouri were
    passed and the open plains of Kansas reached. There its office
    was, unfortunately, the strife of white against white. The
    largest possible range, the greatest possible number of shots
    in a given time, were demanded in a war wherein the opposing
    armies were seldom within five miles of each other, or more
    than one man hurt to five hundred charges of powder burned. How
    the Lenni Lenape must have opened their eyes at this
    reproduction of the drama of a century ago when the whites,
    English and French, were fighting each other for the possession
    of the Delawares' lands in Pennsylvania! The feeble remnant of
    the compatriots of Logan had "moved on," under pressure of a
    very urgent police, a thousand miles westward to a reservation
    not a great deal larger, when portioned out, than that last
    reservation allotted to all men; and the pale-faces who had
    hung upon his track he now saw fighting for
    that.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"

    <p>From its warlike aspect it is pleasant to turn to the
    contributions of the rifle to peaceful amusement, if not
    peaceful industry. Contemptuously giving the go-by to its
    minutest phase in this field&mdash;the "parlor rifle," with a
    target against the chimney-piece or meandering, in feline form,
    along our neighbor's roof-tree&mdash;we go forth, with Snider
    and sunrise, to the forest fastness. Our companions throng,
    tall, bronzed, close-knit and sinewy, true children of the
    four-grooved, from frosty Caucasus, the Hartz, the Alps, the
    Dovrafjeld, the Grampians, the Himmalaya, the Adirondack, the
    Alleghany, the Nevada. The chamois, the ibex, the red deer, the
    Virginia deer, the wapiti, the gour, or the royal tiger may be
    the game in hand. The tiger we are accustomed to associate
    exclusively with the dank jungles of Lower India, but he
    climbs, each summer, the great passes of Central Asia, "the
    roof of the world," and makes his way to the frontier of
    Siberia, beyond 50&deg; north.</p>

    <p>The equipment of the mountain-rifleman is characterized by
    simplicity and a strict attention to business. The nature of
    the ground over which he works inexorably prescribes this. The
    superfluities of the fox-hunter or the partridge-shooter with
    his dog-cart cannot be his. Hatchet, pouch, knife and knapsack,
    with alpenstock on occasion, about comprise his kit. He may be
    attended by a hound or two, but not a pack. He wants no
    yelling. He hears but</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">the Spirit of the Mist,</p>

            <p>And it speaks to the Spirit of the Fell.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>For little hollows and little hills Scott's dogs, that</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i6">raved through the hollow pass amain,</p>

            <p>Chiding the rocks that yelled again,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>may have been highly effective when his medi&aelig;val
    sportsmen, who carried no guns, could keep within a furlong of
    them. But in the depths of the great mountains, with
    point-blank range of six hundred yards and long pops of nearly
    twice that, they would be preposterous. Fancy the Quorndon or
    the Pytchley on the flanks of the Matterhorn!</p>

    <p>Chamois-hunting, the sporting specialty of the Swiss and the
    Tyrolese, appears to be dying out. The hunter of our day keeps
    it up rather as a tradition than as a practical pursuit. He
    rarely bags a "goat," for goats are very few to bag, and those
    few even more supernaturally fleet and sure of foot and keen of
    nose than their less-hunted ancestors. Still, somewhere in that
    upper world of lilac-white that melts into the clouds in vast
    but distance-softened chasms of viscid ice and rifts of gray
    gneiss, there is an object for him. In some nook or on some
    crag of the square leagues of desert that swell around him a
    troop of the desiderated ruminants is grazing, if grazing it
    can be called where grass is none. He is very sure of that.
    Even from the door of his chalet he scans the slopes in the
    half hope of detecting a flock or a single goat. His father and
    his grandfather before him had looked forth from the same door
    on the same scene, snuffed the same "caller air," mentally
    shaped the same pretext for yielding to the same spirit of
    adventure begotten of the peaks and by going forth to battle
    with the solitude, and hunted patiently, sometimes with
    success, oftener without, the progenitors of the same quarry.
    So he prepares himself anew for the wild and perilous tramp. A
    day&mdash;two or three days&mdash;may pass without the
    compassing of a shot, or even hearing the whistle of the
    sentinel goat as he shrills the alarm far out of range and
    leads his fellows in twenty minutes to crags the hunter cannot
    reach in as many hours. Death crouches in the treacherous
    snow-crust beneath or the poised avalanche above. A false step
    or an inch's miscalculation of leap may make him a waif for the
    l&auml;mmergeier or land him among the buried villages of the
    last century. He toils on until success or starvation sends him
    home. In the former case he out-generals his shy game after a
    series of manoeuvres to which the deepest stratagems of our
    Indians are straightforwardness personified. He gets a long
    shot at a distance that would make the musket or buckshot as
    useless as a sabre. The certainty may be apparent that the
    animal, if hit mortally, must fall some hundreds of feet,
    perhaps into an inaccessible
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> chasm. There is no help for
       that. Now or never! The short rifle, assisted by a portable
       rest, is called on for its best. The concentrated energy of
       the whole chase is thrown into the long and carefully
       calculated aim. A thin spurt of white smoke jets forth; a
       sharp report echoes "from peak to peak the rattling crags
       among;" half a dozen chamois whisk around the next
       rock-buttress, and "one more unfortunate" tumbles from the
       verge into vacancy. The labor of days is rewarded. Securing
       the scanty venison if he can, the hunter is off for his
       hillside burrow, advertising his approach by an exultant
       jodel of extra nerve-splitting power.</p>

    <p>In Great Britain the rifle, ancient or modern, like, indeed,
    any other firearm, has yet to establish itself as a democratic
    "institution." Her forests are not forests in our sense, and
    her mountain-dwellers know little of the rifle. In the duke of
    Athol's seventy-mile forest, with scarce a tree save planted
    larches, the stag roams by thousands, but of course the
    game-laws interpose, as they did eight hundred years ago,
    between him and the (biped) hind. He is still the reserved
    luxury of the Norman. So with the leagues of upland where His
    Grace of Sutherland has made the Highlander give place to the
    hart, the "lassie wi' the lint-white locks" to the Cheviot
    ewe&mdash;where, in short, the white Celt has been improved out
    of existence as remorselessly as the red man in America, and
    that in favor not of a superior race of men, but of
    <i>fer&aelig; natur&aelig;</i>. Into these and similar
    districts, at stated seasons, sundry squads of gentlemen are
    turned loose. They either "pay their shot," as <i>Punch</i> has
    it, in the shape of rent, or are the guests of the noble
    proprietors. Their devices for circumventing the antlered
    monarch of the waste are amply detailed by Scrope, Hawker,
    Herbert and also by the late Edwin Landseer doing the pictorial
    department with a success attributable chiefly to his
    management of landscape effect, for his dogs, deer and other
    animals from his &AElig;sop's fable-like groups to his four
    duplicated lions in Trafalgar Square, belong&mdash;heretic that
    we are to say it!&mdash;properly to still life, their want of
    action and <i>verve</i> placing them beneath comparison with
    the works of either one of a score of Flemish and French
    painters, from Rubens and Snyders down to Bonheur and Vernet.
    That his unsold pictures have brought, since his death,
    something like half a million proves nothing. Time was when the
    worthless canvases of West and Morland were equally
    transmutable into gold.</p>

    <p>Like other forms of British field-sports, deer-stalking is
    sufficiently intricate and artificial. It is obviously the
    occupation of men whose primary object is more to kill time
    than to kill deer. According to print, from type and plate, the
    stag, a reduced edition of the American wapiti, is, in the
    heart of a little kingdom of some hundreds of souls to the
    square mile, as little accustomed to the sight of man and as
    hard to approach as he would be on the head-waters of the
    Yellowstone. If five or six hours' worming, <i>ventre &agrave;
    terre</i>, up the bed of a mountain-torrent, with not even a
    rowan-bush to aid concealment, succeed in bringing the
    sports-man within two hundred yards of his unconscious game, it
    is a good day's performance. How, the dun deer's hide once
    perforated, the "tail" of game-keepers, beaters and volunteer
    hangers-on is gathered up, the comforting toothfu' of
    usquebaugh absorbed by the toilers of the brae, the victim
    "gralloched" and suspended across the inevitable gray Highland
    pony that makes such a capital "first light" for the
    foreground, and the line of triumphant march taken up for
    hunting-box, clachan or castle, have we not been told to
    repletion? The tool used on these occasions is up to the latest
    requirements of modern science. Whitworth and Lancaster, thanks
    to their projectile's being wedged in so tight as to cause an
    occasional misunderstanding it and the breech-plug as to which
    was expected to move, have grown unpopular. The style and the
    patentee vary every year or two or oftener, breech-loading and
    the elongated bullet being the only persistent features.</p>

    <p>Among the commonalty of Britain,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> within a very few years past,
       rifle-clubs and matches have been brought greatly into vogue
       under government encouragement. Austria, <i>tu infelix</i>
       this time, having served unwillingly as an experimental
       target, with the most distinguished and gratifying success
       to the experimenters, at Solferino and Sadowa, gave a new
       impetus to the rifle movement in England, as France, a
       trifle later, did to the Battle-of-Dorking school of
       prophetic literature. Thus it happens that the rifle is
       taking its place gradually by the side of fat Durhams,
       gooseberries, lop eared rabbits and the Derby as a popular
       sensation. Johnny sends over a "team," evidently in his
       judgment a whole one, to "shoot the American continent." His
       next deputation ought to be sent, after vanquishing the
       "blarsted" Gothamites, to the recesses of the Alleghany, and
       pitted there against the woodsman with his ancient weapon
       carrying a round ball of seventy-five to the pound, five
       feet long and decorated with tin sights, double trigger and
       mayhap flint-lock. The adventurers would beat in the long
       run, but they would go home not wholly unlearned. Should
       they stay to a turkey-shoot, they would see in it the
       Occidental analogue of their own public matches&mdash;more
       picturesque, if not quite so prim and scientific. Strictly,
       it presupposes conditions non-existent in England&mdash;a
       community, for instance, first of hunters, and second of
       hunters with the rifle.</p>

    <p>This recreation, primarily belonging to localities where
    large game, such as deer and wild-turkeys, is found, has spread
    down to the cities, where it breaks out in a sporadic form
    about Christmas. But the hills are its home&mdash;the
    foot-hills, notably, of the Appalachian range, the domestic
    turkey not being very common higher up, nor its wild original
    ("original," we insist, <i>pace</i> the <i>Agricultural
    Report</i> ornithologist, who finds an ineffaceable distinction
    in the fact that the tail-ring of the one is sometimes, and
    that of the other never, white!) lower down.</p>

    <p>We mind us of an ancient town in the Valley of Virginia,
    settled nearly a century and a half ago by riflemen, sheltered
    by them through a stormy infancy, and still steeped in the
    traditions of the implement in question. Spitted by the
    railway, the hub of many turnpikes, and surrounded by a
    thickly-peopled country, it is yet near enough to the mountains
    to receive from them each winter quite a delegation of their
    inhabitants. Last year wild-turkeys were shot within the
    corporate limits, a deer was chased within half a mile of them,
    and a fine specimen of <i>Felis Canadensis</i> was killed in an
    orchard still nearer.</p>

    <p>Four miles west of the town the fertile limestone
    <i>carse</i> swells into the shady hills, clad largely with
    pine, that form the long glacis of the Alleghanies. These hills
    are peopled principally by a hardy race not unlike the German
    woodsmen, whose blood, indeed, a great many of them share, as
    their surnames, though sadly thinned down into English spelling
    and pronunciation, denote. They inherit, likewise, their fancy
    for the rifle. Allied with the axe, which, like Talleyrand's
    supposititious frontiersman, they have not forgotten, it
    supplies them materially with sport and subsistence. Their
    land, where arable at all, being unproductive as a rule,
    wood-chopping is their most profitable branch of farming. A
    score or two of them drive into town daily, each with his
    four-, three- or two-horse cargo of wood. The pile is
    frequently topped off with a brace or two of ruffed grouse,
    there called pheasant, or a wild-turkey, less often a deer, and
    more often hares; which last multiply along the narrow
    intervales in extraordinary numbers. We have seen three
    sledge-loads of hares&mdash;say two thousand in all&mdash;on
    the street of a winter's day.</p>

    <p>This sappy and sapid contribution to its comfort and luxury
    the town often repays with a jug of whisky as an addendum to
    the cash receipts; although it must not be inferred from this
    that the hillmen are noted for a weakness in that direction.
    Generally, they are as sober as they are hard-working,
    independent and honest. The few who do take kindly to strong
    waters are so hardened by a life of toil and exposure that the
    enemy is a lifetime in bringing them down.. One little old
    hook-nosed fellow was an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> every-day feature of the road
       for fifteen or twenty years. In that entire period he was
       rarely, if once, seen to go out sober. He drove but two
       horses, which were apparently coeval with himself. Long
       practice had taught them perfectly how to accommodate
       themselves to their master's failing. The saddle-horse
       adapted his movements with vigilant dexterity to the rolling
       and pitching aloft. On more than one occasion the woodman
       was found lying in the road by the side or under the feet of
       his faithful and motionless team. Poor old Jack! thou hast
       "gone under," deeper than that, at last, leaving behind thee
       the savor of an honest name, slightly modified by that of
       corn whisky.</p>

    <p>The Hayfield Inn, a little hostelrie on the Northern "pike,"
    is the scene of many a turkey-shoot. Between the hill and the
    road, at the foot of a ravine that runs down at right angles,
    room enough has been scooped out, partly by the rains and
    partly by the pick, for the house, offices and microscopic yard
    decorated with hollyhocks and larkspurs. Across the highway
    stands a capacious barn, with open space for wagons, and
    between it and the brook beyond stretches a narrow meadow,
    whence a vivid imagination has extracted the name of the
    caravanserai. The open space flanking the house and road is the
    rifle-course, so to speak. When occupied of a mellow October
    afternoon by a party of the autochthones, in their pea-jackets
    of blue or hickory homespun, it presents a gay and cheery
    spectacle. Festooning fence and tree around them, the Virginia
    creeper, or <i>Ampelopsis</i>, shames vermilion against the
    mass of pines that glooms skyward beyond. Other tints of
    vegetable decay fringe the brook where it winds from side to
    side of the long strip of grass, green from the autumnal rain.
    Little reck the assembled marksmen of Nature's
    stage-decorations. One group will be mentally weighing the
    turkeys, another discussing the distance&mdash;too long or too
    short for the peculiar powers of this or the other individual
    or his weapon. Around the rude target kneel two or three,
    scoring on it each man his "centre," above or below, to the
    right or left, of the true centre, to counteract the
    ascertained obliquity of his eye or his gun. Here a six-foot
    Stoic, the Nestor of the glen, is very formally going through
    the ceremony of loading. Another is slowly, and with the
    precision of an astronomer, adjusting the tin slides which
    protect his barrel from the glitter of the sun. The chatter of
    a bevy of country maidens ripples from over the way. The horses
    whinny under their square-skirted saddles, or stand "hard by
    their chariots champing golden corn," like the horses of
    Nestor, Agamemnon, Homer and Gladstone before Dr. Schliemann's
    Troy; the yearlings in the meadow alternately gaze and graze;
    the guinea-fowl now and then honors the shout over a good shot
    with its harsh but well-meant rattle; the rifle speaks at
    measured intervals; the prizes thin off to the remainder
    gobbler; and so, with the quiet characteristic of
    rifle-matches, the evening draws toward the dew. The
    smoke-whitened guns are carefully swabbed with tow and prepared
    for their rest as tenderly as infants. Dobbin is rescued from
    the (fence) stake to hie hill-ward with his master, cantering
    exultant or jogging grumly according to the result of the
    "event;" and the metropolis of Petticoat Gap&mdash;for such, in
    the vernacular and on the maps, is its unfortunate
    designation&mdash;relapses into virtuous repose.</p>

    <p>The implement employed at these rural reunions is rarely the
    breech-loader, or even the short gun. It promises to hold its
    ground for years yet, gradually yielding to the little modern
    tool. The essential characteristics of this we have described
    as they exist and will probably remain. Variations in the
    rifling and&mdash;where muzzle-loading is abandoned&mdash;in
    the appliances of the chamber will continue to be made, as they
    have heretofore been made without number numberless. The
    patterns now fashionable will give place to others, in their
    turn to be dropped like a last year's coat. Remington,
    Winchester and the rest will retire in favor of new contrivers,
    devoted, like them, to the simple task of facilitating the
    flight of the leaden arrow with its grooved feather in steel or
    iron. With <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> them will rise and fall a
       parallel series of names on a broader and more sonorous
       field&mdash;the field of heavy artillery, the ponderous
       Wiard being full brother to the liliputian Sharpe. Rifled
       cannon certainly present problems far more complicated than
       the small-arm. They can by no means be considered, as yet,
       so near perfection. It is boldly maintained by many experts,
       both here and in England, that the "smashing" power at
       point-blank range of such smooth-bores as the Rodman 12-inch
       and 15-inch is greater than that of the rifle of the same
       weight. The question is so closely involved with that of
       armor-plates for ships and ports, and that with buoyancy and
       other naval requirements, and economy and stability on land,
       that a long period must elapse ere the reaching of fixed
       conclusions. Within the present generation wooden
       line-of-battle ships, with sails alone, have ruled the wave.
       These have given place to the steam-liners that began and
       closed their brief career at Sebastopol and Bomarsund; and
       the prize-belt is now borne, among the bruisers of the main,
       by the mob of iron-clads, infinitely diverse of aspect and
       some of them shapeless, like the geologic monsters that
       weltered in the primal deep. Which of these is to triumph
       ultimately and devour its misshapen kindred, or whether they
       are not all to go down before the torpedo, that carries no
       gun and fires no shot, is a "survival-of-the-fittest"
       question to be solved by Darwins yet to come. But it is
       tolerably safe to say that where the best shooting is to be
       done it will continue to be done with the conico-cylindrical
       missile, spirally revolving around the line of flight; that
       is, with the arrow-rifle.</p>

    NEIGHBORHOOD," "ROBERT FALCONER," ETC.</h3>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXIV.</h3>

    <h3>THE LAIRD AND HIS MOTHER.</h3>

    <p>When Malcolm and Joseph set out from Duff Harbor to find the
    laird, they could hardly be said to have gone in search of him:
    all in their power was to seek the parts where he was
    occasionally seen, in the hope of chancing upon him; and they
    wandered in vain about the woods of Fife House all that week,
    returning disconsolate every evening to the little inn on the
    banks of the Wan Water. Sunday came and went without yielding a
    trace of him; and, almost in despair, they resolved, if
    unsuccessful the next day, to get assistance and organize a
    search for him. Monday passed like the days that had preceded
    it, and they were returning dejectedly down the left bank of
    the Wan Water in the gloaming, and nearing a part where it is
    hemmed in by precipitous rocks and is very narrow and deep,
    crawling slow and black under the lofty arch of an ancient
    bridge that spans it at one leap, when suddenly they caught
    sight of a head peering at them over the parapet. They dared
    not run for fear of terrifying him if it should be the laird,
    and hurried quietly to the spot. But when they reached the end
    of the bridge its round back was bare from end to end. On the
    other side of the river the trees came close up, and pursuit
    was hopeless in the gathering darkness.</p>

    <p>"Laird, laird! they've ta'en awa' Phemy, an' we dinna ken
    whaur to luik for her," cried the poor father aloud.</p>

    <p>Almost the same instant, and as if he had issued from the
    ground, the laird stood before them. The men started back with
    astonishment&mdash;soon changed into pity, for there was light
    enough to see how miserable the poor fellow looked. Neither
    exposure nor privation had thus weighed upon him: he was simply
    dying of fear. Having greeted Joseph with embarrassment, he
    kept glancing doubtfully at Malcolm, as if ready to run on his
    least movement. In few words Joseph explained their
    quest&mdash;with trembling voice and tears that would not be
    denied enforcing the tale. Ere he had done the laird's jaw had
    fallen and further speech was impossible to him. But by
    gestures sad and plain enough he indicated that he knew nothing
    of her, and had supposed her safe at home with her parents. In
    vain they tried to persuade him to go back with them, promising
    every protection: for sole answer he shook his head
    mournfully.</p>

    <p>There came a sudden gust of wind among the branches. Joseph,
    little used to trees and their ways with the wind, turned
    toward the sound, and Malcolm unconsciously followed his
    movement. When they turned again the laird had vanished, and
    they took their way homeward in sadness.</p>

    <p>What passed next with the laird can be but conjectured. It
    came to be well enough known afterward where he had been
    hiding; and had it not been dusk as they came down the
    river-bank the two men might, looking up to the bridge from
    below, have had it suggested to them. For in the half-spandrel
    wall between the first arch and the bank they might have spied
    a small window looking down on the sullen, silent gloom,
    foam-flecked with past commotion, that crept languidly away
    from beneath. It belonged to a little vaulted chamber in the
    bridge, devised by some vanished lord as a kind of
    summer-house&mdash;long neglected, but having in it yet a
    mouldering table, a broken chair or two and a rough bench. A
    little path led steep from the end of the parapet down to its
    hidden door. It was now used only by the game-keepers for traps
    and fishing-gear and odds and ends of things, and was generally
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
    supposed to be locked up. The laird had, however, found it
    open, and his refuge in it had been connived at by one of the
    men, who, as they heard afterward, had given him the key and
    assisted him in carrying out a plan he had devised for
    barricading the door. It was from this place he had so suddenly
    risen at the call of Blue Peter, and to it he had as suddenly
    withdrawn again&mdash;to pass in silence and loneliness through
    his last purgatorial pain.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>Mrs. Stewart was sitting in her drawing-room alone: she
    seldom had visitors at Kirkbyres&mdash;not that she liked being
    alone, or indeed being there at all, for she would have lived
    on the Continent, but that her son's trustees, partly to
    indulge their own aversion to her, taking upon them a larger
    discretionary power than rightly belonged to them, kept her too
    straitened, which no doubt in the recoil had its share in poor
    Stephen's misery. It was only after scraping for a whole year
    that she could escape to Paris or Homburg, where she was at
    home. There her sojourn was determined by her good or ill
    fortune at faro.</p>

    <p>What she meditated over her knitting by the
    firelight&mdash;she had put out her candles&mdash;it would be
    hard to say, perhaps unwholesome to think: there are souls to
    look into which is, to our dim eyes, like gazing down from the
    verge of one of the Swedenborgian pits.</p>

    <p>But much of the evil done by human beings is as the evil of
    evil beasts: they know not what they do&mdash;an excuse which,
    except in regard to the past, no man can make for himself,
    seeing the very making of it must testify its falsehood.</p>

    <p>She looked up, gave a cry and started to her feet: Stephen
    stood before her, halfway between her and the door. Revealed in
    a flicker of flame from the fire, he vanished in the following
    shade, and for a moment she stood in doubt of her seeing sense.
    But when the coal flashed again there was her son, regarding
    her out of great eyes that looked as if they had seen death. A
    ghastly air hung about him, as if he had just come back from
    Hades, but in his silent bearing there was a sanity, even
    dignity, which strangely impressed her. He came forward a pace
    or two, stopped, and said, "Dinna be frichtit, mem. I'm come.
    Sen' the lassie hame an' du wi' me as ye like. I canna haud aff
    o' me. But I think I'm deein', an' ye needna misguide me."</p>

    <p>His voice, although it trembled a little, was clear and
    unimpeded, and, though weak in its modulation, manly.</p>

    <p>Something in the woman's heart responded. Was it motherhood
    or the deeper godhead? Was it pity for the dignity housed in
    the crumbling clay, or repentance for the son of her womb? Or
    was it that sickness gave hope, and she could afford to be
    kind?</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you mean, Stephen," she said, more gently
    than he had ever heard her speak.</p>

    <p>Was it an agony of mind or of body, or was it but a
    flickering of the shadows upon his face? A moment, and he gave
    a half-choked shriek and fell on the floor. His mother turned
    from him with disgust and rang the bell. "Send Tom here," she
    said.</p>

    <p>An elderly, hard-featured man came.</p>

    <p>"Stephen is in one of his fits," she said.</p>

    <p>The man looked about him: he could see no one in the room
    but his mistress.</p>

    <p>"There he is," she continued, pointing to the floor. "Take
    him away. Get him up to the loft and lay him in the hay."</p>

    <p>The man lifted his master like an unwieldy log and carried
    him, convulsed, from the room.</p>

    <p>Stephen's mother sat down again by the fire and resumed her
    knitting.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXV.</h3>

    <h3>THE LAIRD'S VISION.</h3>

    <p>Malcolm had just seen his master set out for his solitary
    ride when one of the maids informed him that a man from
    Kirkbyres wanted him. Hiding his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> reluctance, he went with her
       and found Tom, who was Mrs. Stewart's grieve and had been
       about the place all his days.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Stephen's come hame, sir," he said, touching his
    bonnet, a civility for which Malcolm was not grateful.</p>

    <p>"It's no possible," returned Malcolm. "I saw him last
    nicht."</p>

    <p>"He cam aboot ten o'clock, sir, an' hed a turn o' the fa'in'
    sickness o' the spot. He's verra ill the noo, an' the mistress
    sent me ower to speir gien ye wad obleege her by gaein' to see
    him."</p>

    <p>"Has he ta'en till's bed?" asked Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"We pat him infill 't, sir. He's ravin' mad, an' I'm
    thinkin' he's no far frae his hin'er en'."</p>

    <p>"I'll gang wi' ye direckly," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>In a few minutes they were riding fast along the road to
    Kirkbyres, neither with much to say to the other, for Malcolm
    distrusted every one about the place, and Tom was by nature
    taciturn.</p>

    <p>"What garred them sen' for me, div ye ken?" asked Malcolm at
    length when they had gone about halfway.</p>

    <p>"He cried oot upo' ye i' the nicht," answered Tom.</p>

    <p>When they arrived Malcolm was shown into the drawing-room,
    where Mrs. Stewart met him with red eyes. "Will you come and
    see my poor boy?" she said.</p>

    <p>"I wull du that, mem. Is he verra ill?"</p>

    <p>"Very. I'm afraid he is in a bad way."</p>

    <p>She led him to a dark, old-fashioned chamber, rich and
    gloomy. There, sunk in the down of a huge bed with carved ebony
    posts, lay the laird, far too ill to be incommoded by the
    luxury to which he was unaccustomed. His head kept tossing from
    side to side and his eyes seemed searching in vacancy.</p>

    <p>"Has the doctor been to see 'im, mem?" asked Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"Yes, but he says he can't do anything for him."</p>

    <p>"Wha waits upon 'im, mem?"</p>

    <p>"One of the maids and myself."</p>

    <p>"I'll jist bide wi' 'im."</p>

    <p>"That will be very kind of you."</p>

    <p>"I s' bide wi' 'im till I see 'im oot o' this, ae w'y or
    ither,", added Malcolm, and sat down by the bedside of his poor
    distrustful friend. There Mrs. Stewart left him.</p>

    <p>The laird was wandering in the thorny thickets and slimy
    marshes which, haunted by the thousand misshapen horrors of
    delirium, beset the gates of life. That one so near the light
    and slowly drifting into it should lie tossing in hopeless
    darkness! Is it that the delirium falls, a veil of love, to
    hide other and more real terrors?</p>

    <p>His eyes would now and then meet those of Malcolm as they
    gazed tenderly upon him, but the living thing that looked out
    of the windows was darkened and saw him not. Occasionally a
    word would fall from him, or a murmur of half-articulation
    float up like the sound of a river of souls; but whether
    Malcolm heard, or only seemed to hear, something like this, he
    could not tell, for he could not be certain that he had not
    himself shaped the words by receiving the babble into the
    moulds of the laird's customary thought and speech: "I dinna
    ken whaur I cam frae&mdash;I kenna whaur I'm gaein'
    till.&mdash;Eh, gien He wad but come oot an' shaw
    Himsel'!&mdash;O Lord! tak the deevil aff o' my puir
    back.&mdash;O Father o' lichts! gar him tak the hump wi' him. I
    hae no fawvor for't, though it's been my constant compainion
    this mony a lang."</p>

    <p>But in general he only moaned, and after the words thus
    heard or fashioned by Malcolm lay silent and nearly still for
    an hour.</p>

    <p>All the waning afternoon Malcolm sat by his side, and
    neither mother, maid nor doctor came near them.</p>

    <p>"Dark wa's an' no a breath!" he murmured or seemed to murmur
    again. "Nae gerse nor flooers nor bees! I hae na room for my
    hump, an' I canna lie upo' 't, for that wad kill me. Wull I
    <i>ever</i> ken whaur I cam frae? The wine's unco guid. Gie me
    a drap mair, gien ye please, Lady Horn.&mdash;I thought the
    grave was a better place. I hae lain safter afore I
    dee'd.&mdash;Phemy! Phemy! Rin, Phemy, rin! I s' bide wi' them
    this time. Ye rin,
    Phemy!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>

    <p>As it grew dark the air turned very chill, and snow began to
    fall thick and fast. Malcolm laid a few sticks on the
    smouldering peat-fire, but they were damp and did not catch.
    All at once the laird gave a shriek, and crying out, "Mither!
    mither!" fell into a fit so violent that the heavy bed shook
    with his convulsions. Malcolm held his wrists and called aloud.
    No one came, and, bethinking himself that none could help, he
    waited in silence for what would soon follow.</p>

    <p>The fit passed quickly, and he lay quiet. The sticks had
    meantime dried, and suddenly they caught fire and blazed up.
    The laird turned his face toward the flame; a smile came over
    it; his eyes opened wide, and with such an expression of seeing
    gazed beyond Malcolm that he turned his in the same
    direction.</p>

    <p>"Eh, the bonny man! The bonny man!" murmured the laird.</p>

    <p>But Malcolm saw nothing, and turned again to the laird: his
    jaw had fallen, and the light was fading out of his face like
    the last of a sunset. He was dead.</p>

    <p>Malcolm rang the bell, told the woman who answered it what
    had taken place, and hurried from the house, glad at heart that
    his friend was at rest.</p>

    <p>He had ridden but a short distance when he was overtaken by
    a boy on a fast pony, who pulled up as he neared him.</p>

    <p>"Whaur are ye for?" asked Malcolm. "I'm gaein' for Mistress
    Cat'nach," answered the boy.</p>

    <p>"Gang yer w'ys than, an' dinna haud the deid waitin'," said
    Malcolm with a shudder.</p>

    <p>The boy cast a look of dismay behind him and galloped
    off.</p>

    <p>The snow still fell and the night was dark. Malcolm spent
    nearly two hours on the way, and met the boy returning, who
    told him that Mrs. Catanach was not to be found.</p>

    <p>His road lay down the glen, past Duncan's cottage, at whose
    door he dismounted, but he did not find him. Taking the bridle
    on his arm, he walked by his horse the rest of the way. It was
    about nine o'clock, and the night very dark. As he neared the
    house, he heard Duncan's voice. "Malcolm, my son! Will it pe
    your ownself?" it said.</p>

    <p>"It wull that, daddy," answered Malcolm.</p>

    <p>The piper was sitting on a fallen tree, with the snow
    settling softly upon him.</p>

    <p>"But it's ower cauld for ye to be sittin' there i' the snaw,
    an' the mirk tu," added Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"Ta tarkness will not be ketting to ta inside of her,"
    returned the seer. "Ah, my poy! where ta light kets in, ta
    tarkness will pe ketting in too. This now, your whole pody will
    pe full of tarkness, as ta Piple will say, and Tuncan's pody
    tat will pe full of ta light." Then with suddenly changed tone
    he said, "Listen, Malcolm, my son! Shell pe ferry uneasy till
    you'll wass pe come home."</p>

    <p>"What's the maitter noo, daddy?" returned Malcolm. "Onything
    wrang aboot the hoose?"</p>

    <p>"Something will pe wrong, yes, put she'll not can tell
    where. No, her pody will not pe full of light! For town here,
    in ta curset Lowlands, ta sight has peen almost cone from her,
    my son. It will now pe no more as a co creeping troo' her, and
    shell nefer see plain no more till she'll pe come pack to her
    own mountains."</p>

    <p>"The puir laird's gane back to his," said Malcolm. "I won'er
    gien he kens yet, or gien he gangs speirin' at ilk ane he meets
    gien he can tell him whaur he cam frae. He's mad nae mair, ony
    gait."</p>

    <p>"How? Will he pe not tead? Ta poor lairt! Ta poor maad
    lairt!"</p>

    <p>"Ay, he's deid: maybe that's what'll be troublin' yer sicht,
    daddy."</p>

    <p>"No, my son. Ta maad lairt was not ferry maad, and if he was
    maad he was not paad, and it was not ta plame of him: he was
    coot always, howefer."</p>

    <p>"He wass that, daddy."</p>

    <p>"But it will pe something ferry paad, and it will pe efer
    troubling her speerit. When she'll pe take ta pipes to pe
    amusing herself, and will plow 'Till an crodh a' Dhonnaehaidh'
    ('Turn the Cows, Duncan'), out will pe come' Cumhadh an fhir
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span> mhoir' ('The Lament of the
       Big Man'). Aal is not well, my son."</p>

    <p>"Weel, dinna distress yersel', daddy. Lat come what wull
    come. Foreseein' 's no forefen'in'. Ye ken yersel' at mony 's
    the time the seer has broucht the thing on by tryin' to haud it
    aff."</p>

    <p>"It will be true, my son. Put it would aalways haf
    come."</p>

    <p>"Nae doubt. Sae ye jist come in wi' me, daddy, an' sit doon
    by the ha' fire, an' I'll come to ye as sune's I've been to see
    'at the maister disna want me. But ye'll better come up wi' me
    to my room first," he went on, "for the maister disna like to
    see me in onything but the kilt."</p>

    <p>"And why will he not pe in ta kilts aal as now?"</p>

    <p>"I hae been ridin', ye ken, daddy, an' the trews fits the
    saiddle better nor the kilts."</p>

    <p>"She'll not pe knowing tat. Old Allister, your
    creat&mdash;her own crandfather, was ta pest horseman ta worlt
    efer saw, and he'll nefer pe hafing ta trews to his own lecks
    nor ta saddle to his horse's pack. He'll chust make his men pe
    strap on an old plaid, and he'll be kive a chump, and away they
    wass, horse and man, one peast, aal two of tem poth
    together."</p>

    <p>Thus chatting, they went to the stable, and from the stable
    to the house, where they met no one, and went straight up to
    Malcolm's room, the old man making as little of the long ascent
    as Malcolm himself.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXVI.</h3>

    <h3>THE CRY FROM THE CHAMBER.</h3>

    <p>Brooding&mdash;if a man of his temperament may ever be said
    to brood&mdash;over the sad history of his young wife and the
    prospects of his daughter, the marquis rode over fields and
    through gates&mdash;he never had been one to jump a fence in
    cold blood&mdash;till the darkness began to fall; and the
    bearings of his perplexed position came plainly before him.</p>

    <p>First of all, Malcolm acknowledged and the date of his
    mother's death known, what would Florimel be in the eyes of the
    world? Supposing the world deceived by the statement that his
    mother died when he was born, where yet was the future he had
    marked out for her? He had no money to leave her, and she must
    be helplessly dependent on her brother.</p>

    <p>Malcolm, on the other hand, might make a good match, or,
    with the advantages he could secure him in the army, still
    better in the navy, well enough push his way in the world.</p>

    <p>Miss Horn could produce no testimony, and Mrs. Catanach had
    asserted him to be the son of Mrs. Stewart. He had seen enough,
    however, to make him dread certain possible results if Malcolm
    were acknowledged as the laird of Kirkbyres. No: there was but
    one hopeful measure, one which he had even already approached
    in a tentative way&mdash;an appeal, namely, to Malcolm himself,
    in which, while acknowledging his probable rights, but
    representing in the strongest manner the difficulty of proving
    them, he would set forth in their full dismay the consequences
    to Florimel of their public recognition, and offer, upon the
    pledge of his word to a certain line of conduct, to start him
    in any path he chose to follow.</p>

    <p>Having thought the thing out pretty thoroughly, as he
    fancied, and resolved at the same time to feel his way toward
    negotiations with Mistress Catanach, he turned and rode
    home.</p>

    <p>After a tolerable dinner he was sitting over a bottle of the
    port which he prized beyond anything else his succession had
    brought him, when the door of the dining-room opened suddenly
    and the butler appeared, pale with terror. "My lord! my lord!"
    he stammered as he closed the door behind him.</p>

    <p>"Well? What the devil's the matter now? Whose cow's
    dead?"</p>

    <p>"Your lordship didn't hear it, then?" faltered the
    butler.</p>

    <p>"You've been drinking, Bings," said the marquis, lifting his
    seventh glass of port.</p>

    <p>"<i>I</i> didn't say I heard it, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Heard what, in the name of
    Beelzebub?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>

    <p>"The ghost, my lord."</p>

    <p>"The what?" shouted the marquis.</p>

    <p>"That's what they call it, my lord. It's all along of having
    that wizard's chamber in the house, my lord."</p>

    <p>"You're a set of fools," said the marquis&mdash;"the whole
    kit of you!"</p>

    <p>"That's what I say, my lord. I don't know what to do with
    them, stericking and screaming. Mrs. Courthope is trying her
    best with them, but it's my belief she's about as bad
    herself."</p>

    <p>The marquis finished his glass of wine, poured out and drank
    another, then walked to the door. When the butler opened it a
    strange sight met his eyes. All the servants in the house, men
    and women, Duncan and Malcolm alone excepted, had crowded after
    the butler, every one afraid of being left behind; and there
    gleamed the crowd of ghastly faces in the light of the great
    hall-fire. Demon stood in front, his mane bristling and his
    eyes flaming. Such was the silence that the marquis heard the
    low howl of the waking wind, and the snow like the patting of
    soft hands against the windows. He stood for a moment, more
    than half enjoying their terror, when from somewhere in the
    building a far-off shriek, shrill and piercing, rang in every
    ear. Some of the men drew in their breath with a gasping sob,
    but most of the women screamed outright; and that set the
    marquis cursing.</p>

    <p>Duncan and Malcolm had but just entered the bed-room of the
    latter when the shriek rent the air close beside, and for a
    moment deafened them. So agonized, so shrill, so full of dismal
    terror was it, that Malcolm stood aghast, and Duncan started to
    his feet with responsive outcry. But Malcolm at once recovered
    himself. "Bide here till I come back," he whispered, and
    hurried noiselessly out.</p>

    <p>In a few minutes he returned, during which all had been
    still. "Noo, daddy," he said, "I'm gaein' to drive in the door
    o' the neist room. There's some deevilry at wark there. Stan'
    ye i' the door, an' ghaist or deevil 'at wad win by ye, grip
    it, an' haud on like Demon the dog."</p>

    <p>"She will so, she will so," muttered Duncan in a strange
    tone. "Ochone! that she'll not pe hafing her turk with her!
    Ochone! ochone!"</p>

    <p>Malcolm took the key of the wizard's chamber from his chest
    and his candle from the table, which he set down in the
    passage. In a moment he had unlocked the door, put his shoulder
    to it and burst it open. A light was extinguished, and a
    shapeless figure went gliding away through the gloom. It was no
    shadow, however, for, dashing itself against a door at the
    other side of the chamber, it staggered back with an
    imprecation of fury and fear, pressed two hands to its head,
    and, turning at bay, revealed the face of Mrs. Catanach.</p>

    <p>In the door stood the blind piper with outstretched arms and
    hands ready to clutch, the fingers curved like claws, his knees
    and haunches bent, leaning forward like a rampant beast
    prepared to spring. In his face was wrath, hatred, vengeance,
    disgust&mdash;an enmity of all mingled kinds.</p>

    <p>Malcolm was busied with something in the bed, and when she
    turned Mrs, Catanach saw only Duncan's white face of hatred
    gleaming through the darkness. "Ye auld donnert deevil!" she
    cried, with an addition too coarse to be set down, and threw
    herself upon him.</p>

    <p>The old man said never a word, but with indrawn breath
    hissing through his clenched teeth clutched her, and down they
    went together in the passage, the piper undermost. He had her
    by the throat, it is true, but she had her fingers in his eyes,
    and, kneeling on his chest, kept him down with a vigor of
    hostile effort that drew the very picture of murder. It lasted
    but a moment, however, for the old man, spurred by torture as
    well as hate, gathered what survived of a most sinewy strength
    into one huge heave, threw her back into the room, and rose
    with the blood streaming from his eyes, just as the marquis
    came round the near end of the passage, followed by Mrs.
    Courthope, the butler, Stoat and two of the footmen. Heartily
    enjoying a row, he stopped instantly, and, signing a halt to
    his followers, stood listening to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"
       id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span> mud-geyser that now burst
       from Mrs. Catanach's throat.</p>

    <p>"Ye blin' abortion o' Sawtan's soo!" she cried, "didna I tak
    ye to du wi' ye as I likit? An' that deil's tripe ye ca' yer
    oye (<i>grandson</i>)&mdash;He! he! <i>him</i> yer gran'son!
    He's naething but ane o' yer hatit Cawm'ells!"</p>

    <p>"A teanga a' diabhuil mhoir, tha thu ag d&egrave;namh breug
    (O tongue of the great devil! thou art making a lie)," screamed
    Duncan, speaking for the first time.</p>

    <p>"God lay me deid i' my sins gien he be onything but a
    bastard Cawm'ell!" she asseverated with a laugh of demoniacal
    scorn. "Yer dautit (<i>petted</i>) Ma'colm's naething but the
    dyke-side brat o' the late Grizel Cawm'ell, 'at the fowk tuik
    for a sant 'cause she grat an' said naething. I laid the
    Cawm'ell pup i' yer boody (<i>scarecrow</i>) airms wi' my ain
    han's, upo' the tap o' yer curst scraighin' bagpipes 'at sae
    aften drave the sleep frae my een. Na, ye wad nane o' me! But I
    ga'e ye a Cawm'ell bairn to yer hert for a' that, ye auld,
    hungert, weyver (<i>spider</i>)-leggit, worm-aten idiot!"</p>

    <p>A torrent of Gaelic broke from Duncan, into the midst of
    which rushed another from Mrs. Catanach, similar, but coarse in
    vowel and harsh in consonant sounds. The marquis stepped into
    the room. "What is the meaning of all this?" he said with
    dignity.</p>

    <p>The tumult of Celtic altercation ceased. The old piper drew
    himself up to his full height and stood silent. Mrs. Catanach,
    red as fire with exertion and wrath, turned ashy pale. The
    marquis cast on her a searching and significant look.</p>

    <p>"See here, my lord," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>Candle in hand, his lordship approached the bed. At the same
    moment Mrs. Catanach glided out with her usual downy step, gave
    a wink as of mutual intelligence to the group at the door, and
    vanished.</p>

    <p>On Malcolm's arm lay the head of a young girl. Her thin,
    worn countenance was stained with tears and livid with
    suffocation. She was recovering, but her eyes rolled stupid and
    visionless.</p>

    <p>"It's Phemy, my lord&mdash;Blue Peter's lassie, 'at was
    tint," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"It begins to look serious," said the marquis.&mdash;"Mrs.
    Catanach! Mrs. Courthope!"</p>

    <p>He turned toward the door. Mrs. Courthope entered, and a
    head or two peeped in after her. Duncan stood as before, drawn
    up and stately, his visage working, but his body motionless as
    the statue of a sentinel.</p>

    <p>"Where is the Catanach woman gone?" cried the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Cone!" shouted the piper. "Cone! and her huspant will be
    waiting to pe killing her! Och nan ochan!"</p>

    <p>"Her husband!" echoed the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Ach! she'll not can pe helping it, my lort&mdash;no more
    till one will pe tead; and tat should pe ta woman, for she'll
    pe a paad woman&mdash;ta worstest woman efer was married, my
    lort."</p>

    <p>"That's saying a good deal," returned the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Not one wort more as enough, my lort," said Duncan. "She
    was only pe her next wife, put, ochone! ochone! why did she'll
    pe marry her? You would haf stapt her long aco, my lort, if
    she'll was your wife and you was knowing ta tamned fox and
    padger she was pe. Ochone! and she tidn't pe have her turk at
    her hench nor her sgian in her hose."</p>

    <p>He shook his hands like a despairing child, then stamped and
    wept in the agony of frustrated rage.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Courthope took Phemy in her arms and carried her to her
    own room, where she opened the window and let the snowy wind
    blow full upon her. As soon as she came quite to herself,
    Malcolm set out to bear the good tidings to her father and
    mother.</p>

    <p>Only a few nights before had Phemy been taken to the room
    where they found her. She had been carried from place to place,
    and had been some time, she believed, in Mrs. Catanach's own
    house. They had always kept her in the dark, and removed her at
    night blindfolded. When asked if she had never cried out
    before, she said she had been too frightened; and when
    questioned as to what had made her do so then, she knew nothing
    of it: she remembered only that a horrible creature appeared by
    the bedside, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> after which all was blank. On
       the floor they found a hideous death-mask, doubtless the
       cause of the screams which Mrs. Catanach had sought to
       stifle with the pillows and bed-clothes.</p>

    <p>When Malcolm returned he went at once to the piper's
    cottage, where he found him in bed, utterly exhausted and as
    utterly restless. "Weel, daddy," he said, "I doobt I daurna
    come near ye noo."</p>

    <p>"Come to her arms, my poor poy," faltered Duncan. "She'll pe
    sorry in her sore heart for her poy. Nefer you pe minding, my
    son: you couldn't help ta Cam'ell mother, and you'll pe her own
    poy however. Ochone! it will pe a plot upon you aal your tays,
    my son, and she'll not can help you, and it'll pe preaking her
    old heart."</p>

    <p>"Gien God thoucht the Cam'ells worth makin', daddy, I dinna
    see 'at I hae ony richt to compleen 'at I cam' o' them."</p>

    <p>"She hopes you'll pe forgifing ta plind old man, however.
    She couldn't see, or she would haf known at once petter."</p>

    <p>"I dinna ken what ye're efter noo, daddy," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"That she'll do you a creat wrong, and she'll be ferry sorry
    for it, my son."</p>

    <p>"What wrang did ye ever du me, daddy?"</p>

    <p>"That she was let you crow up a Cam'ell, my poy. If she tid
    put know ta paad blood was pe in you, she wouldn't pe tone you
    ta wrong as pring you up."</p>

    <p>"That's a wrang no ill to forgi'e, daddy. But it's a pity ye
    didna lat me lie, for maybe syne Mistress Catanach wad hae
    broucht me up hersel', an' I micht hae come to something."</p>

    <p>"Ta duvil mhor (<i>great</i>) would pe in your heart and
    prain and poosom, my son."</p>

    <p>"Weel, ye see what ye hae saved me frae."</p>

    <p>"Yes; put ta duvil will be to pay, for she couldn't safe you
    from ta Cam'ell plood, my son. Malcolm, my poy," he added after
    a pause, and with the solemnity of a mighty hate, "ta efil
    woman herself will pe a Cam'ell&mdash;ta woman Catanach will pe
    a Cam'ell, and her nainsel' she'll not know it pefore she'll be
    in ta ped with ta worstest Cam'ell tat ever God made; and she
    pecks his pardon, for she'll not pelieve He wass making ta
    Cam'ells."</p>

    <p>"Divna ye think God made me, daddy?" asked Malcolm.</p>

    <p>The old man thought for a little. "Tat will tepend on who
    was pe your father, my son," he replied. "If he too will be a
    Cam'ell&mdash;ochone! ochone! Put tere may pe some coot plood
    co into you&mdash;more as enough to say God will pe make you,
    my son. Put don't pe asking, Malcolm&mdash;ton't you'll pe
    asking."</p>

    <p>"What am I no to ask, daddy?"</p>

    <p>"Ton't pe asking who made you, who was ta father to you, my
    poy. She would rather not pe knowing, for ta man might pe a
    Cam'ell poth. And if she couldn't pe lofing you no more, my
    son, she would pe tie before her time, and her tays would pe
    long in ta land under ta crass, my son."</p>

    <p>But the remembrance of the sweet face whose cold loveliness
    he had once kissed was enough to outweigh with Malcolm all the
    prejudices of Duncan's instillation, and he was proud to take
    up even her shame. To pass from Mrs. Stewart to her was to
    escape from the clutches of a vampire demon to the arms of a
    sweet mother-angel.</p>

    <p>Deeply concerned for the newly-discovered misfortunes of the
    old man to whom he was indebted for this world's life at least,
    he anxiously sought to soothe him; but he had far more and far
    worse to torment him than Malcolm even yet knew, and with
    burning cheeks and bloodshot eyes he lay tossing from side to
    side, now uttering terrible curses in Gaelic and now weeping
    bitterly. Malcolm took his loved pipes, and with the gentlest
    notes he could draw from them tried to charm to rest the
    ruffled waters of his spirit; but his efforts were all in vain,
    and believing at length that he would be quieter without him,
    he went to the House and to his own room.</p>

    <p>The door of the adjoining chamber stood open, and the
    long-forbidden room lay exposed to any eye. Little did Malcolm
    think as he gazed around it that it was the room in which he
    had first breathed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> the air of the world; in
       which his mother had wept over her own false position and
       his reported death; and from which he had been carried, by
       Duncan's wicked wife, down the ruinous stair and away to the
       lip of the sea, to find a home in the arms of the man whom
       he had just left on his lonely couch torn between the
       conflicting emotions of a gracious love for him and the
       frightful hate of her.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXVII.</h3>

    <h3>FEET OF WOOL.</h3>

    <p>The next day, Miss Horn, punctual as Fate, presented herself
    at Lossie House, and was shown at once into the marquis's
    study, as it was called. When his lordship entered she took the
    lead the moment the door was shut. "By this time, my lord,
    ye'll doobtless hae made up yer min' to du what's richt?" she
    said.</p>

    <p>"That's what I have always wanted to do," returned the
    marquis.</p>

    <p>"Hm!" remarked Miss Horn as plainly as inarticulately.</p>

    <p>"In this affair," he supplemented; adding, "It's not always
    so easy to tell what <i>is</i> right."</p>

    <p>"It's no aye easy to luik for 't wi' baith yer een," said
    Miss Horn.</p>

    <p>"This woman Catanach&mdash;we must get her to give credible
    testimony. Whatever the fact may be, we must have strong
    evidence. And there comes the difficulty, that she has already
    made an altogether different statement."</p>

    <p>"It gangs for naething, my lord. It was never made afore a
    justice o' the peace."</p>

    <p>"I wish you would go to her and see how she is
    inclined."</p>

    <p>"Me gang to Bawbie Catanach!" exclaimed Miss Horn. "I wad as
    sune gang an' kittle Sawtan's nose wi' the p'int o' 's tail.
    Na, na, my lord. Gien onybody gang till her wi' my wull, it s'
    be a limb o' the law. I s' hae nae cognostin' wi' her."</p>

    <p>"You would have no objection, however; to my seeing her, I
    presume&mdash;just to let her know that we have an inkling of
    the truth?" said the marquis.</p>

    <p>Now, all this was the merest talk, for of course Miss Horn
    could not long remain in ignorance of the declaration her fury
    had, the night previous, forced from Mrs. Catanach; but he
    must, he thought, put her off and keep her quiet, if possible,
    until he had come to an understanding with Malcolm, after which
    he would no doubt have his trouble with her.</p>

    <p>"Ye can du as yer lordship likes," answered Miss Horn, "but
    I wadna hae 't said o' me 'at I had ony dealin's wi' her. Wha
    kens but she micht say ye tried to bribe her? There's naething
    she wad bogle at gien she thoucht it worth her while. No 'at I
    'm feart at her. Lat her lee! I'm no sae blate but&mdash;Only
    dinna lippen till a word she says, my lord."</p>

    <p>The marquis hesitated. "I wonder whether the real source of
    my perplexity occurs to you, Miss Horn," he said at length.
    "You know I have a daughter?"</p>

    <p>"Weel eneuch that, my lord."</p>

    <p>"By my second marriage."</p>

    <p>"Nae merridge ava', my lord."</p>

    <p>"True, if I confess to the first."</p>

    <p>"A' the same whether or no, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Then you see," the marquis went on, refusing offence, "what
    the admission of your story would make of my daughter?"</p>

    <p>"That's plain eneuch, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Now, if I have read Malcolm right he has too much regard
    for his&mdash;mistress&mdash;to put her in such a false
    position."</p>

    <p>"That is, my lord, ye wad hae yer lawfu' son beir the
    lawless name."</p>

    <p>"No, no: it need never come out what he is. I will provide
    for him&mdash;as a gentleman, of course."</p>

    <p>"It canna be, my lord. Ye can du naething for him, wi' that
    face o' his, but oot comes the trouth as to the father o' 'im;
    an' it wadna be lang afore the tale was ekit oot wi' the name
    o' his mither&mdash;Mistress Catanach wad see to that, gien
    'twas only to spite me&mdash;an' I wunna hae my Grizel ca'd
    what she is not for ony lord's dauchter i' the three
    kynriks."</p>

    <p>"What <i>does</i> it matter, now she's dead and gone?" said
    the marquis, false to the dead in his love for the
    living.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>

    <p>"Deid an' gane, my lord? What ca' ye deid an' gane? Maybe
    the great anes o' the yerth get sic a forlethie
    (<i>surfeit</i>) o' grand'ur 'at they're for nae mair, an' wad
    perish like the brute beast. For onything I ken, they may hae
    their wuss, but for mysel', I wad warstle to haud my sowl
    waukin' (<i>awake</i>) i' the verra article o' deith, for the
    bare chance o' seein' my bonny Grizel again. It's a mercy I hae
    nae feelin's," she added, arresting her handkerchief on its way
    to her eyes, and refusing to acknowledge the single tear that
    ran down her cheek.</p>

    <p>Plainly she was not like any of the women whose characters
    the marquis had accepted as typical of womankind.</p>

    <p>"Then you won't leave the matter to her husband and son?" he
    said reproachfully.</p>

    <p>"I tellt ye, my lord, I wad du naething but what I saw to be
    richt. Lat this affair oot o' my han's I daurna. That laad ye
    micht work to onything 'at made agane himsel'. He's jist like
    his puir mither there."</p>

    <p>"If Miss Campbell <i>was</i> his mother," said the
    marquis.</p>

    <p>"Miss Cam'ell!" cried Miss Horn. "I'll thank yer lordship to
    ca' her by her ain, an' that's Lady Lossie."</p>

    <p>What of the something ruinous heart of the marquis was
    habitable was occupied by his daughter, and had no
    accommodation at present either for his dead wife or his living
    son. Once more he sat thinking in silence for a while. "I'll
    make Malcolm a post-captain in the navy and give you a thousand
    pounds," he said at length, hardly knowing that he spoke.</p>

    <p>Miss Horn rose to her full height and stood like an angel of
    rebuke before him. Not a word did she speak, only looked at him
    for a moment and turned to leave the room. The marquis saw his
    danger, and striding to the door stood with his back against
    it.</p>

    <p>"Think ye to scare <i>me</i>, my lord?" she asked with a
    scornful laugh. "Gang an' scare the stane lion-beast at yer
    ha'-door. Haud oot o' the gait an' lat me gang."</p>

    <p>"Not until I know what you are going to do," said the
    marquis very seriously.</p>

    <p>"I hae naething mair to transac' wi' yer lordship. You an'
    me 's strangers, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Tut! tut! I was but trying you."</p>

    <p>"An' gien I had ta'en the disgrace ye offert me, ye wad hae
    drawn back?"</p>

    <p>"No, certainly."</p>

    <p>"Ye wasna tryin' me, then: ye was duin' yer best to corrup'
    me."</p>

    <p>"I'm no splitter of hairs."</p>

    <p>"My lord, it's nane but the corrup'ible wad seek to
    corrup'."</p>

    <p>The marquis gnawed a nail or two in silence. Miss Horn
    dragged an easy-chair within a couple of yards of him.</p>

    <p>"We'll see wha tires o' this ghem first, my lord," she said
    as she sank into its hospitable embrace.</p>

    <p>The marquis turned to lock the door, but there was no key in
    it. Neither was there any chair within reach, and he was not
    fond of standing. Clearly, his enemy had the advantage.</p>

    <p>"Hae ye h'ard o' puir Sandy Graham&mdash;hoo they're
    misguidin' him, my lord?" she asked with composure.</p>

    <p>The marquis was first astounded, and then tickled by her
    assurance. "No," he answered.</p>

    <p>"They hae turnt him oot o' hoose an' ha'&mdash;schuil, at
    least, an' hame," she rejoined. "I may say they hae turnt him
    oot o' Scotlan', for what presbytery wad hae him efter he had
    been fun' guilty o' no thinkin' like ither fowk? Ye maun stan'
    his guid freen', my lord."</p>

    <p>"He shall be Malcolm's tutor," answered the marquis, not to
    be outdone in coolness, "and go with him to Edinburgh&mdash;or
    Oxford, if he prefers it."</p>

    <p>"Never yerl o' Colonsay had a better," said Miss Horn.</p>

    <p>"Softly, softly, ma'am," returned the marquis. "I did not
    say he should go in that style."</p>

    <p>"He s' gang as my lord o' Colonsay or he s' no gang at
    <i>your</i> expense, my lord," said his antagonist.</p>

    <p>"Really, ma'am, one would think you were my grandmother, to
    hear you order my affairs for me."</p>

    <p>"I wuss I war, my lord: I sud gar ye hear risson upo' baith
    sides o' yer heid, I s' warran'."</p>

    <p>The marquis laughed. "Well, I can't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> stand here all day," he said,
       impatiently swinging one leg.</p>

    <p>"I'm weel awaur o' that, my lord," answered Miss Horn,
    rearranging her scanty skirt.</p>

    <p>"How long are you going to keep me, then?"</p>

    <p>"I wadna hae ye bide a meenute langer nor's agreeable to
    yersel'. But <i>I</i>'m in nae hurry sae lang's ye're afore me.
    Ye're nae ill to luik at, though ye maun hae been bonnier the
    day ye wan the hert o' my Grizel."</p>

    <p>The marquis uttered an oath and left the door. Miss Horn
    sprang to it, but there was the marquis again. "Miss Horn," he
    said, "I beg you will give me another day to think of
    this."</p>

    <p>"Whaur's the use? A' the thinkin' i' the warl' canna alter a
    single fac'. Ye maun do richt by my laddie o' yer ainsel', or I
    maun gar ye."</p>

    <p>"You would find a lawsuit heavy, Miss Horn."</p>

    <p>"An' ye wad fin' the scandal o' 't ill to bide, my lord. It
    wad come sair upo' Miss&mdash;I kenna what name she has a richt
    till, my lord."</p>

    <p>The marquis uttered a frightful imprecation, left the door,
    and, sitting down, hid his face in his hands.</p>

    <p>Miss Horn rose, but instead of securing her retreat,
    approached him gently and stood by his side. "My lord," she
    said, "I canna thole to see a man in tribble. Women's born till
    't, an' they tak it an' are thankfu'; but a man never gies in
    till 't, an' sae it comes harder upo' him nor upo' them. Hear
    me, my lord: gien there be a man upo' this earth wha wad shield
    a woman, that man's Ma'colm Colonsay."</p>

    <p>"If only she weren't his sister!" murmured the marquis.</p>

    <p>"An' jist bethink ye, my lord: wad it be onything less nor
    an imposition to lat a man merry her ohn tellt him what she
    was?"</p>

    <p>"You insolent old woman!" cried the marquis, losing his
    temper, discretion and manners all together. "Go and do your
    worst, and be damned to you!"</p>

    <p>So saying, he left the room, and Miss Horn found her way out
    of the house in a temper quite as fierce as his&mdash;in
    character, however, entirely different, inasmuch as it was
    righteous.</p>

    <p>At that very moment Malcolm was in search of his master, and
    seeing the back of him disappear in the library, to which he
    had gone in a half-blind rage, he followed him. "My lord!" he
    said.</p>

    <p>"What do you want?" returned his master in a rage. For some
    time he had been hauling on the curb-rein, which had fretted
    his temper the more, and when he let go the devil ran away with
    him.</p>

    <p>"I thoucht yer lordship wad like to see an auld stair I cam
    upo' the ither day, 'at gangs frae the wizard's
    chaumer&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Go to hell with your damned tomfoolery!" said the marquis.
    "If ever you mention that cursed hole again I'll kick you out
    of the house."</p>

    <p>Malcolm's eyes flashed and a fierce answer rose to his lips,
    but he had seen that his master was in trouble, and sympathy
    supplanted rage. He turned and left the room in silence.</p>

    <p>Lord Lossie paced up and down the library for a whole
    hour&mdash;a long time for him to be in one mood. The mood
    changed color pretty frequently during the hour, however, and
    by degrees his wrath assuaged. But at the end of it he knew no
    more what he was going to do than when he left Miss Horn in the
    study. Then came the gnawing of his usual ennui and
    restlessness: he must find something to do.</p>

    <p>The thing he always thought of first was a ride, but the
    only animal of horse-kind about the place which he liked was
    the bay mare, and her he had lamed. He would go and see what
    the rascal had come bothering about&mdash;alone, though, for he
    could not endure the sight of the fisher-fellow, damn him!</p>

    <p>In a few minutes he stood in the wizard's chamber, and
    glanced around it with a feeling of discomfort rather than
    sorrow&mdash;of annoyance at the trouble of which it had been
    for him both fountain and storehouse, rather than regret for
    the agony and contempt which his selfishness had brought upon
    the woman he loved: then spying the door in the farthest
    corner, he made for it, and in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> moment more, his curiosity
       now thoroughly roused, was slowly gyrating down the steps of
       the old screw-stair.</p>

    <p>But Malcolm had gone to his own room, and, hearing some one
    in the next, half suspected who it was, and went in. Seeing the
    closet-door open, he hurried to the stair, and shouted, "My
    lord! my lord! or whaever ye are! tak care hoo ye gang or ye'll
    get a terrible fa'."</p>

    <p>Down a single yard the stair was quite dark, and he dared
    not follow fast for fear of himself falling and occasioning the
    accident he feared. As he descended he kept repeating his
    warnings, but either his master did not hear or heeded too
    little, for presently Malcolm heard a rush, a dull fall and a
    groan. Hurrying as fast as he dared with the risk of falling
    upon him, he found the marquis lying amongst the stones in the
    ground entrance, apparently unable to move, and white with
    pain. Presently, however, he got up, swore a good deal and
    limped swearing into the house.</p>

    <p>The doctor, who was sent for instantly, pronounced the
    knee-cap injured, and applied leeches. Inflammation set in, and
    another doctor and surgeon were sent for from Aberdeen. They
    came, applied poultices, and again leeches, and enjoined the
    strictest repose. The pain was severe, but to one of the
    marquis's temperament the enforced quiet was worse.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h3>

    <h3>HANDS OF IRON.</h3>

    <p>The marquis was loved by his domestics, and his accident,
    with its consequences, although none more serious were
    anticipated, cast a gloom over Lossie House. Far apart as was
    his chamber from all the centres of domestic life, the pulses
    of his suffering beat as it were through the house, and the
    servants moved with hushed voice and gentle footfall.</p>

    <p>Outside, the course of events waited upon his recovery, for
    Miss Horn, was too generous not to delay proceedings while her
    adversary was ill. Besides, what she most of all desired was
    the marquis's free acknowledgment of his son; and after such a
    time of suffering and constrained reflection as he was now
    passing through he could hardly fail, she thought, to be more
    inclined to what was just and fair.</p>

    <p>Malcolm had of course hastened to the schoolmaster with the
    joy of his deliverance from Mrs. Stewart, but Mr. Graham had
    not acquainted him with the discovery Miss Horn had made, or
    her belief concerning his large interest therein, to which
    Malcolm's report of the wrath-born declaration of Mrs. Catanach
    had now supplied the only testimony wanting, for the right of
    disclosure was Miss Horn's. To her he had carried Malcolm's
    narrative of late events, tenfold strengthening her position;
    but she was anxious in her turn that the revelation concerning
    his birth should come to him from his father. Hence, Malcolm
    continued in ignorance of the strange dawn that had begun to
    break on the darkness of his origin.</p>

    <p>Miss Horn had told Mr. Graham what the marquis had said
    about the tutorship, but the schoolmaster only shook his head
    with a smile, and went on with his preparations for
    departure.</p>

    <p>The hours went by, the days lengthened into weeks, and the
    marquis's condition did not improve. He had never known
    sickness and pain before, and like most of the children of this
    world counted them the greatest of evils; nor was there any
    sign of their having as yet begun to open his eyes to what
    those who have seen them call truths&mdash;those who have never
    even boded their presence count absurdities.</p>

    <p>More and more, however, he desired the attendance of
    Malcolm, who was consequently a great deal about him, serving
    with a love to account for which those who knew his nature
    would not have found it necessary to fall back on the instinct
    of the relation between them. The marquis had soon satisfied
    himself that that relation was as yet unknown to him, and was
    all the better pleased with his devotion and
    tenderness.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

    <p>The inflammation continued, increased, spread, and at length
    the doctors determined to amputate. But the marquis was
    absolutely horrified at the idea&mdash;shrank from it with
    invincible repugnance. The moment the first dawn of
    comprehension vaguely illuminated their periphrastic approaches
    he blazed out in a fury, cursed them frightfully, called them
    all the contemptuous names in his rather limited vocabulary,
    and swore he would see them&mdash;uncomfortable first.</p>

    <p>"We fear mortification, my lord," said the physician
    calmly.</p>

    <p>"So do I. Keep it off," returned the marquis.</p>

    <p>"We fear we cannot, my lord." It had, in fact, already
    commenced.</p>

    <p>"Let it mortify, then, and be damned," said his
    lordship.</p>

    <p>"I trust, my lord, you will reconsider it," said the
    surgeon. "We should not have dreamed of suggesting a measure of
    such severity had we not had reason to dread that the further
    prosecution of gentler means would but lessen your lordship's
    chance of recovery."</p>

    <p>"You mean, then, that my life is in danger?"</p>

    <p>"We fear," said the physician, "that the amputation proposed
    is the only thing that can save it."</p>

    <p>"What a brace of blasted bunglers you are!" cried the
    marquis, and, turning away his face, lay silent.</p>

    <p>The two men looked at each other and said nothing.</p>

    <p>Malcolm was by, and a pang shot to his heart at the verdict.
    The men retired to consult. Malcolm approached the bed. "My
    lord!" he said gently.</p>

    <p>No reply came.</p>

    <p>"Dinna lea 's oor lanes, my lord&mdash;no yet," Malcolm
    persisted. "What's to come o' my leddy?"</p>

    <p>The marquis gave a gasp. Still he made no reply.</p>

    <p>"She has naebody, ye ken, my lord, 'at ye wad like to lippen
    her wi'."</p>

    <p>"You must take care of her when I am gone, Malcolm,"
    murmured the marquis; and his voice was now gentle with sadness
    and broken with misery.</p>

    <p>"Me, my lord!" returned Malcolm. "Wha wad min' me? An' what
    cud I du wi' her? I cudna even hand her ohn wat her feet. Her
    leddy's maid cud du mair wi' her, though I wad lay doon my life
    for her, as I tauld ye, my lord; an' she kens 't weel
    eneuch."</p>

    <p>Silence followed. Both men were thinking.</p>

    <p>"Gie me a richt, my lord, an' I'll du my best," said
    Malcolm, at length breaking the silence.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" growled the marquis, whose mood had
    altered.</p>

    <p>"Gie me a legal richt, my lord, an' see gien I dinna."</p>

    <p>"See what?"</p>

    <p>"See gien I dinna luik weel efter my leddy."</p>

    <p>"How am I to see? I shall be dead and damned."</p>

    <p>"Please God, my lord, ye'll be alive an' weel&mdash;in a
    better place, if no here to luik efter my leddy yersel'."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I dare say," muttered the marquis.</p>

    <p>"But ye'll hearken to the doctors, my lord," Malcolm went
    on, "an' no dee wantin' time to consider o' 't."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes: to-morrow I'll have another talk with them. We'll
    see about it. There's time enough yet. They're all coxcombs,
    every one of them. They never give a patient the least credit
    for common sense."</p>

    <p>"I dinna ken, my lord," said Malcolm doubtfully.</p>

    <p>After a few minutes' silence, during which Malcolm thought
    he had fallen asleep, the marquis resumed abruptly. "What do
    you mean by giving you a legal right?" he said.</p>

    <p>"There's some w'y o' makin' ae body guairdian till anither,
    sae 'at the law 'll uphaud him&mdash;isna there, my lord?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, surely. Well! Rather odd&mdash;wouldn't it be?&mdash;a
    young fisher-lad guardian to a marchioness! Eh? They say
    there's nothing new under the sun, but that sounds rather like
    it, I think."</p>

    <p>Malcolm was overjoyed to hear him speak with something like
    his old manner. He felt he could stand any amount of chaff from
    him now, and so the proposition he had made in seriousness he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> went on to defend in the hope
       of giving amusement, yet with a secret wild delight in the
       dream of such full devotion to the service of Lady
       Florimel.</p>

    <p>"It wad soon' queer eneuch, my lord, nae doobt, but fowk
    maunna min' the soon' o' a thing gien 't be a' straucht an'
    fair, an' strong eneuch to stan'. They cudna lauch me oot o' my
    richts, be they 'at they likit&mdash;Lady Bellair or ony o'
    them&mdash;na, nor jaw me oot o' them aither."</p>

    <p>"They might do a good deal to render those rights of little
    use," said the marquis.</p>

    <p>"That wad come till a trial o' brains, my lord," returned
    Malcolm: "an' ye dinna think I wadna hae the wit to speir
    advice; an', what's mair, to ken whan it was guid, an' tak it.
    There's lawyers, my lord."</p>

    <p>"And their expenses?"</p>

    <p>"Ye cud lea' sae muckle to be waured (<i>spent</i>) upo' the
    cairryin' oot o' yer lordship's wull."</p>

    <p>"Who would see that you applied it properly?"</p>

    <p>"My ain conscience, my lord, or Mr. Graham gien ye
    likit."</p>

    <p>"And how would you live yourself?"</p>

    <p>"Ow! lea' ye that to me, my lord. Only dinna imagine I wad
    be behauden to yer lordship. I houp I hae mair pride nor that.
    Ilka poun'-not', shillin' an' bawbee sud be laid oot for
    <i>her</i>, an' what was left hainet (<i>saved</i>) for
    her."</p>

    <p>"By Jove! it's a daring proposal!" said the marquis; and,
    which seemed strange to Malcolm, not a single thread of
    ridicule ran through the tone in which he made the remark.</p>

    <p>The next day came, but brought neither strength of body nor
    of mind with it. Again his professional attendants besought
    him, and he heard them more quietly, but rejected their
    proposition as positively as before. In a day or two he ceased
    to oppose it, but would not hear of preparation. Hour glided
    into hour, and days had gathered to a week, when they assailed
    him with a solemn and last appeal.</p>

    <p>"Nonsense!" answered the marquis. "My leg is getting better.
    I feel no pain&mdash;in fact, nothing but a little faintness.
    Your damned medicines, I haven't a doubt."</p>

    <p>"You are in the greatest danger, my lord. It is all but too
    late even now."</p>

    <p>"To-morrow, then, if it must be. To-day I could not endure
    to have my hair cut, positively; and as to having my leg
    off&mdash;pooh! the thing's preposterous."</p>

    <p>He turned white and shuddered, for all the nonchalance of
    his speech.</p>

    <p>When to-morrow came there was not a surgeon in the land who
    would have taken his leg off. He looked in their faces, and
    seemed for the first time convinced of the necessity of the
    measure.</p>

    <p>"You may do as you please," he said: "I am ready."</p>

    <p>"Not to-day, my lord," replied the doctor&mdash;"your
    lordship is not equal to it to-day."</p>

    <p>"I understand," said the marquis, and paled frightfully and
    turned his head aside.</p>

    <p>When Mrs. Courthope suggested that Lady Florimel should be
    sent for, he flew into a frightful rage, and spoke as it is to
    be hoped he had never spoken to a woman before. She took it
    with perfect gentleness, but could not repress a tear. The
    marquis saw it, and his heart was touched. "You mustn't mind a
    dying man's temper," he said.</p>

    <p>"It's not for myself, my lord," she answered.</p>

    <p>"I know: you think I'm not fit to die; and, damn it! you are
    right. Never one was less fit for heaven or less willing to go
    to hell."</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't you like to see a clergyman, my lord?" she
    suggested, sobbing.</p>

    <p>He was on the point of breaking out into a still worse
    passion, but controlled himself. "A clergyman!" he cried: "I
    would as soon see the undertaker. What could he do but tell me
    I was going to be damned&mdash;a fact I know better than he
    can? That is, if it's not all an invention of the cloth, as, in
    my soul, I believe it is. I've said so any time these forty
    years."</p>

    <p>"Oh, my lord! my lord! do not fling away your last
    hope."</p>

    <p>"You imagine me to have a chance, then? Good soul! you don't
    know any better."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

    <p>"The Lord is merciful."</p>

    <p>The marquis laughed&mdash;that is, he tried, failed, and
    grinned.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Cairns is in the dining-room, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Bah! A low pettifogger, with the soul of a bullock. Don't
    let me hear the fellow's name. I've been bad enough, God knows,
    but I haven't sunk to the level of <i>his</i> help yet. If he's
    God Almighty's factor, and the saw holds, 'Like master, like
    man,' well, I would rather have nothing to do with either."</p>

    <p>"That is, if you had the choice, my lord," said Mrs.
    Courthope, her temper yielding somewhat, though in truth his
    speech was not half so irreverent as it seemed to her.</p>

    <p>"Tell him to go to hell. No, don't: set him down to a bottle
    of port and a great sponge-cake, and you needn't tell him to go
    to heaven, for he'll be there already. Why, Mrs. Courthope, the
    fellow isn't a gentleman. And yet all he cares for the cloth is
    that he thinks it makes a gentleman of him&mdash;as if anything
    in heaven, earth or hell could work that miracle!"</p>

    <p>In the middle of the night, as Malcolm sat by his bed,
    thinking him asleep, the marquis spoke suddenly. "You must go
    to Aberdeen to-morrow, Malcolm," he said.</p>

    <p>"Verra weel, my lord."</p>

    <p>"And bring Mr. Glennie, the lawyer, back with you."</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Go to bed, then."</p>

    <p>"I wad raither bide, my lord. I cudna sleep a wink for
    wantin' to be back aside ye."</p>

    <p>The marquis yielded, and Malcolm sat by him all the night
    through. He tossed about, would doze off and murmur strangely,
    then wake up and ask for brandy and water, yet be content with
    the lemonade Malcolm gave him.</p>

    <p>Next day he quarreled with every word that Mrs. Courthope
    uttered, kept forgetting he had sent Malcolm away, and was
    continually wanting him. His fits of pain were more severe,
    alternated with drowsiness, which deepened at times to
    stupor.</p>

    <p>It was late before Malcolm returned. He went instantly to
    his bedside.</p>

    <p>"Is Mr. Glennie with you?" asked his master feebly.</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Tell him to come here at once."</p>

    <p>When Malcolm returned with the lawyer the marquis directed
    him to place a table and chair by the bedside, light four
    candles, provide everything necessary for writing and go to
    bed.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXIX.</h3>

    <h3>THE MARQUIS AND THE SCHOOLMASTER.</h3>

    <p>Before Malcolm was awake his lordship had sent for him. When
    he re-entered the sick chamber Mr. Glennie had vanished, the
    table had been removed, and, instead of the radiance of the
    wax-lights, the cold gleam of a vapor-dimmed sun, with its
    sickly blue-white reflex from the widespread snow, filled the
    room. The marquis looked ghastly, but was sipping chocolate
    with a spoon.</p>

    <p>"What w'y are ye the day, my lord?" asked Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"Nearly well," he answered; "but those cursed carrion-crows
    are set upon killing me&mdash;damn their souls!"</p>

    <p>"We'll hae Leddy Florimel sweirin' awfu' gien ye gang on
    that gait, my lord," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>The marquis laughed feebly.</p>

    <p>"An' what's mair," Malcolm continued, "I doobt they're some
    partic'lar aboot the turn o' their phrases up yonner, my
    lord."</p>

    <p>The marquis looked at him keenly. "You don't anticipate that
    inconvenience for me?" he said. "I'm pretty sure to have my
    billet where they're not so precise."</p>

    <p>"Dinna brak my hert, my lord," cried Malcolm, the tears
    rushing to his eyes.</p>

    <p>"I should be sorry to hurt you, Malcalm," rejoined the
    marquis gently, almost tenderly. "I won't go there if I can
    help it&mdash;I shouldn't like to break any more
    hearts&mdash;but how the devil am I to keep out of it? Besides,
    there are people up there I don't want to meet: I have no fancy
    for being made ashamed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> of myself. The fact is, I'm
       not fit for such company, and I don't believe there is any
       such place. But if there be, I trust in God there isn't any
       other, or it will go badly with your poor master, Malcolm.
       It doesn't look <i>like</i> true&mdash;now does it? Only
       such a multitude of things I thought I had done with for
       ever keep coming up and grinning at me. It nearly drives me
       mad, Malcolm; and I would fain die like a gentleman, with a
       cool bow and a sharp face-about."</p>

    <p>"Wadna ye hae a word wi' somebody 'at kens, my lord?" said
    Malcolm, scarcely able to reply.</p>

    <p>"No," answered the marquis fiercely. "That Cairns is a
    fool."</p>

    <p>"He's a' that, an' mair, my lord. I didna mean
    <i>him</i>."</p>

    <p>"They're all fools together."</p>

    <p>"Ow, na, my lord. There's a heap o' them no muckle better,
    it may be; but there's guid men an' true amang them, or the
    Kirk wad hae been wi' Sodom and Gomorrah by this time. But it's
    no a minister I wad hae yer lordship confar wi'."</p>

    <p>"Who, then? Mrs. Courthope, eh?"</p>

    <p>"Ow na, my lord&mdash;no Mistress Courthoup. She's a guid
    body, but she wadna believe her ain een gien onybody ca'd a
    minister said contrar' to them."</p>

    <p>"Who the devil do you mean, then?"</p>

    <p>"Nae deevil, but an honest man 'at's been his warst enemy
    sae lang 's I hae kent him&mdash;Maister Graham, the
    schuil-maister."</p>

    <p>"Pooh!" said the marquis with a puff. "I'm too old to go to
    school."</p>

    <p>"I dinna ken the man 'at isna a bairn till <i>him</i>, my
    lord."</p>

    <p>"In Greek and Latin?"</p>

    <p>"I' richteousness an' trouth, my lord&mdash;in what's been
    an' what is to be."</p>

    <p>"What! has he the second sight, like the piper?"</p>

    <p>"He <i>has</i> the second sicht, my lord, but ane 'at gangs
    a sicht farther nor my auld daddy's."</p>

    <p>"He could tell me, then, what's going to become of me?"</p>

    <p>"As weel 's ony man, my lord."</p>

    <p>"That's not saying much, I fear."</p>

    <p>"Maybe mair nor ye think, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Well, take him my compliments and tell him I should like to
    see him," said the marquis after a minute's silence.</p>

    <p>"He'll come direckly, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Of course he will," said the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Jist as readily, my lord, as he wad gang to ony tramp 'at
    sent for 'im at sic a time," returned Malcolm, who did not
    relish either the remark or its tone.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean by that? <i>You</i> don't think it such a
    serious affair, do you?"</p>

    <p>"My lord, ye haena a chance."</p>

    <p>The marquis was dumb. He had actually begun once more to
    buoy himself up with earthly hopes.</p>

    <p>Dreading a recall of his commission, Malcolm slipped from
    the room, sent Mrs. Courthope to take his place, and sped to
    the schoolmaster. The moment Mr. Graham heard the marquis's
    message he rose without a word and led the way from the
    cottage. Hardly a sentence passed between them as they went,
    for they were on a solemn errand.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Graham's here, my lord," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"Where? Not in the room?" returned the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Waitin' at the door, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Bah! You needn't have been so ready. Have you told the
    sexton to get a new spade? But you may let him in; and leave
    him alone with me."</p>

    <p>Mr. Graham walked gently up to the bedside.</p>

    <p>"Sit down, sir," said the marquis courteously, pleased with
    the calm, self-possessed, unobtrusive bearing of the man. "They
    tell me I'm dying, Mr. Graham."</p>

    <p>"I'm sorry it seems to trouble you, my lord."</p>

    <p>"What! wouldn't it trouble you, then?"</p>

    <p>"I don't think so, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Ah! you're one of the elect, no doubt?"</p>

    <p>"That's a thing I never did think about, my lord."</p>

    <p>"What do you think about, then?"</p>

    <p>"About God."</p>

    <p>"And when you die you'll go straight to heaven, of
    course?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know, my lord. That's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span> another thing I never trouble
       my head about."</p>

    <p>"Ah! you're like me, then. <i>I</i> don't care much about
    going to heaven. What do you care about?"</p>

    <p>"The will of God. I hope your lordship will say the
    same."</p>

    <p>"No I won't: I want my own will."</p>

    <p>"Well, that is to be had, my lord."</p>

    <p>"How?"</p>

    <p>"By taking his for yours as the better of the two, which it
    must be every way."</p>

    <p>"That's all moonshine."</p>

    <p>"It <i>is</i> light, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Well, I don't mind confessing, if I am to die, I should
    prefer heaven to the other place, but I trust I have no chance
    of either. Do you now honestly believe there are two such
    places?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know, my lord."</p>

    <p>"You don't know? And you come here to comfort a dying
    man!"</p>

    <p>"Your lordship must first tell me what you mean by 'two
    <i>such</i> places.' And as to comfort, going by my notions, I
    cannot tell which you would be more or less comfortable in; and
    that, I presume, would be the main point with your
    lordship."</p>

    <p>"And what, pray, sir, would be the main point with you?"</p>

    <p>"To get nearer to God."</p>

    <p>"Well, I can't say <i>I</i> want to get nearer to God. It's
    little he's ever done for me."</p>

    <p>"It's a good deal he has tried to do for you, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Well, who interfered? Who stood in his way, then?"</p>

    <p>"Yourself, my lord."</p>

    <p>"I wasn't aware of it. When did he ever try to do anything
    for me and I stood in his way?"</p>

    <p>"When he gave you one of the loveliest of women, my lord,"
    said Mr. Graham with solemn, faltering voice, "and you left her
    to die in neglect and her child to be brought up by
    strangers."</p>

    <p>The marquis gave a cry. The unexpected answer had roused the
    slowly-gnawing death and made it bite deeper.</p>

    <p>"What have <i>you</i> to do," he almost screamed, "with my
    affairs? It was for <i>me</i> to introduce what I chose of
    them. You presume."</p>

    <p>"Pardon me, my lord: you led me to what I was bound to say.
    Shall I leave you, my lord?"</p>

    <p>The marquis made no answer. "God knows I loved her," he said
    after a while with a sigh.</p>

    <p>"You loved her, my lord?"</p>

    <p>"I did, by God!"</p>

    <p>"Love a woman like that and come to this?"</p>

    <p>"Come to this? We must all come to this, I fancy, sooner or
    later. Come to what, in the name of Beelzebub?"</p>

    <p>"That, having loved a woman like her, you are content to
    lose her. In the name of God, have you no desire to see her
    again?"</p>

    <p>"It would be an awkward meeting," said the marquis.</p>

    <p>His was an old love, alas! He had not been capable of the
    sort that defies change. It had faded from him until it seemed
    one of the things that are not. Although his being had once
    glowed in its light, he could now speak of a meeting as
    awkward.</p>

    <p>"Because you wronged her?" suggested the schoolmaster.</p>

    <p>"Because they lied to me, by God!"</p>

    <p>"Which they dared not have done had you not lied to them
    first."</p>

    <p>"Sir!" shouted the marquis, with all the voice he had
    left.&mdash;"O God, have mercy! I <i>cannot</i> punish the
    scoundrel."</p>

    <p>"The scoundrel is the man who lies, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Were I anywhere else&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"There would be no good in telling you the truth, my lord.
    You showed her to the world as a woman over whom you had
    prevailed, and not as the honest wife she was. What <i>kind</i>
    of a lie was that, my lord? Not a white one, surely?"</p>

    <p>"You are a damned coward to speak so to a man who cannot
    even turn on his side to curse you for a base hound. You would
    not dare it but that you know I cannot defend myself."</p>

    <p>"You are right, my lord: your conduct is indefensible."</p>

    <p>"By Heaven! if I could but get this cursed leg under me, I
    would throw you out of the window."</p>

    <p>"I shall go by the door, my lord.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> While you hold by your sins,
       your sins will hold by you. If you should want me again I
       shall be at your lordship's command."</p>

    <p>He rose and left the room, but had not reached his cottage
    before Malcolm overtook him with a second message from his
    master. He turned at once, saying only, "I expected it."</p>

    <p>"Mr. Graham," said the marquis, looking ghastly, "you must
    have patience with a dying man. I was very rude to you, but I
    was in horrible pain."</p>

    <p>"Don't mention it, my lord. It would be a poor friendship
    that gave way for a rough word."</p>

    <p>"How can you call yourself my friend?"</p>

    <p>"I should be your friend, my lord, if it were only for your
    wife's sake. She died loving you. I want to send you to her, my
    lord. You will allow that, as a gentleman, you at least owe her
    an apology."</p>

    <p>"By Jove, you are right, sir! Then you really and positively
    believe in the place they call heaven?"</p>

    <p>"My lord, I believe that those who open their hearts to the
    truth shall see the light on their friends' faces again, and be
    able to set right what was wrong between them."</p>

    <p>"It's a week too late to talk of setting right."</p>

    <p>"Go and tell her you are sorry, my lord&mdash;that will be
    enough for her."</p>

    <p>"Ah! but there's more than her concerned."</p>

    <p>"You are right, my lord. There is another&mdash;One who
    cannot be satisfied that the fairest works of his hands, or
    rather the loveliest children of his heart, should be treated
    as you have treated women."</p>

    <p>"But the Deity you talk of&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon, my lord: I talked of no deity. I talked
    of a living Love that gave us birth and calls us his children.
    Your deity I know nothing of."</p>

    <p>"Call Him what you please: <i>He</i> won't be put off so
    easily."</p>

    <p>"He won't be put off, one jot or one tittle. He will forgive
    anything, but He will pass nothing. Will your wife forgive
    you?"</p>

    <p>"She will, when I explain."</p>

    <p>"Then why should you think the forgiveness of God, which
    created her forgiveness, should be less?"</p>

    <p>Whether the marquis could grasp the reasoning may be
    doubtful.</p>

    <p>"Do you really suppose God cares whether a man comes to good
    or ill?"</p>

    <p>"If He did not, He could not be good Himself."</p>

    <p>"Then you don't think a good God would care to punish poor
    wretches like us?"</p>

    <p>"Your lordship has not been in the habit of regarding
    himself as a poor wretch. And, remember, you can't call a child
    a poor wretch without insulting the father of it."</p>

    <p>"That's quite another thing."</p>

    <p>"But on the wrong side for your argument, seeing the
    relation between God and the poorest creature is infinitely
    closer than that between any father and his child."</p>

    <p>"Then He can't be so hard on him as the parsons say."</p>

    <p>"He will give him absolute justice, which is the only good
    thing. He will spare nothing to bring his children back to
    Himself, their sole well-being. What would you do, my lord, if
    you saw your son strike a woman?"</p>

    <p>"Knock him down and horsewhip him."</p>

    <p>It was Mr. Graham who broke the silence that followed: "Are
    you satisfied with yourself, my lord?"</p>

    <p>"No, by God!"</p>

    <p>"You would like to be better?"</p>

    <p>"I would."</p>

    <p>"Then you are of the same mind with God."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but I'm not a fool. It won't do to say I should like
    to be. I must be it, and that's not so easy. It's damned hard
    to be good. I would have a fight for it, but there's no time.
    How is a poor devil to get out of such an infernal scrape?"</p>

    <p>"Keep the commandments."</p>

    <p>"That's it, of course; but there's no time, I tell
    you&mdash;no time; at least, so those cursed doctors will keep
    telling me."</p>

    <p>"If there were but time to draw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> another breath, there would
       be time to begin."</p>

    <p>"How am I to begin? Which am I to begin with?"</p>

    <p>"There is one commandment which includes all the rest."</p>

    <p>"Which is that?"</p>

    <p>"To believe in the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

    <p>"That's cant."</p>

    <p>"After thirty years' trial of it, it is to me the essence of
    wisdom. It has given me a peace which makes life or death all
    but indifferent to me, though I would choose the latter."</p>

    <p>"What am I to believe about Him, then?"</p>

    <p>"You are to believe <i>in</i> Him, not about Him."</p>

    <p>"I don't understand."</p>

    <p>"He is our Lord and Master, Elder Brother, King, Saviour,
    the divine Man, the human God: to believe in Him is to give
    ourselves up to Him in obedience&mdash;to search out his will
    and do it."</p>

    <p>"But there's no time, I tell you again," the marquis almost
    shrieked.</p>

    <p>"And I tell you there is all eternity to do it in. Take Him
    for your master, and He will demand nothing of you which you
    are not able to perform. This is the open door to bliss. With
    your last breath you can cry to Him, and He will hear you as He
    heard the thief on the cross, who cried to Him dying beside
    him: 'Lord, remember me when Thou comest into Thy
    kingdom.'&mdash;'To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.' It
    makes my heart swell to think of it, my lord. No
    cross-questioning of the poor fellow, no preaching to him. He
    just took him with Him where He was going, to make a man of
    him."</p>

    <p>"Well, you know something of my history: what would you have
    me do now?&mdash;at once, I mean. What would the Person you are
    speaking of have me do?"</p>

    <p>"That is not for me to say, my lord."</p>

    <p>"You could give me a hint."</p>

    <p>"No. God is telling you Himself. For me to presume to tell
    you would be to interfere with Him. What He would have a man do
    He lets him know in his mind."</p>

    <p>"But what if I had not made up my mind before the last
    came?"</p>

    <p>"Then I fear He would say to you, 'Depart from me, thou
    worker of iniquity.'"</p>

    <p>"That would be hard when another minute might have done
    it."</p>

    <p>"If another minute would have done it, you would have had
    it."</p>

    <p>A paroxysm of pain followed, during which Mr. Graham
    silently left him.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER LXX.</h3>

    <h3>END OR BEGINNING?</h3>

    <p>When the fit was over and he found Mr. Graham was gone, he
    asked Malcolm, who had resumed his watch, how long it would
    take Lady Florimel to come from Edinburgh.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Crathie left wi' fower horses frae the Lossie Airms
    last nicht, my lord," said Malcolm; "but the ro'ds are ill, an'
    she winna be here afore some time the morn."</p>

    <p>The marquis stared aghast: they had sent for her without his
    orders. "What <i>shall</i> I do?" he murmured. "If once I look
    in her eyes, I shall be damned.&mdash;Malcolm!"</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>"Is there a lawyer in Portlossie?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord: there's auld Maister Carmichael."</p>

    <p>"He won't do: he was my brother's rascal. Is there no one
    besides?"</p>

    <p>"No in Portlossie, my lord. There can be nane nearer than
    Duff Harbor, I doobt."</p>

    <p>"Take the chariot and bring him here directly. Tell them to
    put four horses to: Stokes can ride one."</p>

    <p>"I'll ride the ither, my lord."</p>

    <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind: you're not used to the
    pole."</p>

    <p>"I can tak the leader, my lord."</p>

    <p>"I tell you you're to do nothing of the kind," cried the
    marquis angrily. "You're to ride inside, and bring
    Mr.&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;back with you."</p>

    <p>"Soutar, my lord, gien ye please."</p>

    <p>"Be off, then. Don't wait to feed. The brutes have been
    eating all day, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> they can eat all night. You
       must have him here in an hour."</p>

    <p>In an hour and a quarter Miss Horn's friend stood by the
    marquis's bedside, Malcolm was dismissed, but was presently
    summoned again to receive more orders.</p>

    <p>Fresh horses were put to the chariot, and he had to set out
    once more&mdash;this time to fetch a justice of the peace, a
    neighbor laird. The distance was greater than to Duff Harbor;
    the roads were worse; the north wind, rising as they went, blew
    against them as they returned, increasing to a violent gale;
    and it was late before they reached Lossie House.</p>

    <p>When Malcolm entered he found the marquis alone.</p>

    <p>"Is Morrison here at last?" he cried, in a feeble, irritated
    voice.</p>

    <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

    <p>"What the devil kept you so long? The bay mare would have
    carried me there and back in an hour and a half."</p>

    <p>"The roads war verra heavy, my lord. An' jist hear till the
    win'."</p>

    <p>The marquis listened a moment, and a frightened expression
    grew over his thin, pale, anxious face. "You don't know what
    depends on it," he said, "or you would have driven better.
    Where is Mr. Soutar?"</p>

    <p>"I dinna ken, my lord. I'm only jist come, an' I've seen
    naebody."</p>

    <p>"Go and tell Mrs. Courthope I want Soutar. You'll find her
    crying somewhere&mdash;the old chicken!&mdash;because I swore
    at her. What harm could that do the old goose?"</p>

    <p>"It'll be mair for love o' yer lordship than fricht at the
    sweirin', my lord."</p>

    <p>"You think so? Why should <i>she</i> care? Go and tell her
    I'm sorry. But really she ought to be used to me by this time.
    Tell her to send Soutar directly."</p>

    <p>Mr. Soutar was not to be found, the fact being that he had
    gone to see Miss Horn. The marquis flew into an awful rage, and
    began to curse and swear frightfully.</p>

    <p>"My lord! my lord!" said Malcolm, "for God's sake, dinna
    gang on that gait. He canna like to hear that kin' o' speech;
    an' frae ane o' his ain' tu!"</p>

    <p>The marquis stopped, aghast at his presumption and choking
    with rage, but Malcolm's eyes filled with tears, and, instead
    of breaking out again, his master turned his head away and was
    silent.</p>

    <p>Mr. Soutar came.</p>

    <p>"Fetch Morrison," said the marquis, "and go to bed."</p>

    <p>The wind howled terribly as Malcolm ascended the stairs and
    half felt his way, for he had no candle, through the long
    passages leading to his room. As he entered the last a huge
    vague form came down upon him like a deeper darkness through
    the dark. Instinctively he stepped aside. It passed
    noiselessly, with a long stride, and not even a rustle of its
    garments&mdash;at least Malcolm heard nothing but the roar of
    the wind. He turned and followed it. On and on it went, down
    the stair, through a corridor, down the great stone turnpike
    stair, and through passage after passage. When it came into the
    more frequented and half-lighted thoroughfares of the house it
    showed as a large figure in a long cloak, indistinct in
    outline.</p>

    <p>It turned a corner close by the marquis's room. But when
    Malcolm, close at its heels, turned also, he saw nothing but a
    vacant lobby, the doors around which were all shut. One after
    another he quickly opened them, all except the marquis's, but
    nothing was to be seen. The conclusion was that it had entered
    the marquis's room. He must not disturb the conclave in the
    sick chamber with what might be but "a false creation
    proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain," and turned back to
    his own room, where he threw himself on his bed and fell
    asleep.</p>

    <p>About twelve Mrs. Courthope called him: his master was
    worse, and wanted to see him.</p>

    <p>The midnight was dark and still, for the wind had ceased.
    But a hush and a cloud seemed gathering in the stillness and
    darkness, and with them came the sense of a solemn celebration,
    as if the gloom were canopy as well as pall&mdash;black, but
    bordered and hearted with purple and gold; and the terrible
    stillness seemed to tremble as with the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span> inaudible tones of a great
       organ at the close or commencement of some mighty
       symphony.</p>

    <p>With beating heart he walked softly toward the room where,
    as on an altar, lay the vanishing form of his master, like the
    fuel in whose dying flame was offered the late and ill-nurtured
    sacrifice of his spirit.</p>

    <p>As he went through the last corridor leading thither, Mrs.
    Catanach, type and embodiment of the horrors that haunt the
    dignity of death, came walking toward him like one at home, her
    great round body lighty upborne on her soft foot. It was no
    time to challenge her presence, and yielding her the half of
    the narrow way he passed without a greeting. She dropped him a
    courtesy with an up-look and again a veiling of her wicked
    eyes.</p>

    <p>The marquis would not have the doctors come near him, and
    when Malcolm entered there was no one in the room but Mrs.
    Courthope. The shadow had crept far along the dial. His face
    had grown ghastly, the skin had sunk to the bones, and his eyes
    stood out as if from much staring into the dark. They rested
    very mournfully on Malcolm for a few moments, and then closed
    softly.</p>

    <p>"Is she come yet?" he murmured, opening them wide with
    sudden stare.</p>

    <p>"No, my lord."</p>

    <p>The lids fell again, softly, slowly.</p>

    <p>"Be good to her, Malcolm," he murmured.</p>

    <p>"I wull, my lord," said Malcolm solemnly.</p>

    <p>Then the eyes opened and looked at him: something grew in
    them, a light as of love, and drew up after it a tear; but the
    lips said nothing. The eyelids fell again, and in a minute more
    Malcolm knew by his breathing that he slept.</p>

    <p>The slow night waned. He woke sometimes, but soon dozed off
    again. The two watched by him till the dawn. It brought a still
    gray morning, without a breath of wind and warm for the season.
    The marquis appeared a little revived, but was hardly able to
    speak. Mostly by signs he made Malcolm understand that he
    wanted Mr. Graham, but that some one else must go for him. Mrs.
    Courthope went.</p>

    <p>As soon as she was out of the room he lifted his hand with
    effort, laid feeble hold on Malcolm's jacket, and, drawing him
    down, kissed him on the forehead. Malcolm burst into tears and
    sank weeping by the bedside.</p>

    <p>Mr. Graham, entering a little after, and seeing Malcolm on
    his knees, knelt also and broke into a prayer.</p>

    <p>"O blessed Father!" he said, "who knowest this thing, so
    strange to us, which we call death, breathe more life into the
    heart of Thy dying son, that in the power of life he may front
    death. O Lord Christ! who diedst Thyself, and in Thyself
    knowest it all, heal this man in his sore need&mdash;heal him
    with strength to die."</p>

    <p>A faint <i>Amen</i> came from the marquis.</p>

    <p>"Thou didst send him into the world: help him out of it. O
    God! we belong to Thee utterly. We dying men are Thy children,
    O living Father! Thou art such a father that Thou takest our
    sins from us and throwest them behind Thy back. Thou cleansest
    our souls as Thy Son did wash our feet. We hold our hearts up
    to Thee: make them what they must be, O Love! O Life of men! O
    Heart of hearts! Give Thy dying child courage and hope and
    peace&mdash;the peace of Him who overcame all the terrors of
    humanity, even death itself, and liveth for evermore, sitting
    at Thy right hand, our God-brother, blessed to all ages.
    Amen."</p>

    <p>"Amen!" murmured the marquis, and, slowly lifting his hand
    from the coverlid, he laid it on the head of Malcolm, who did
    not know it was the hand of his father blessing him ere he
    died.</p>

    <p>"Be good to her," said the marquis once more.</p>

    <p>But Malcolm could not answer for weeping, and the marquis
    was not satisfied. Gathering all his force, he said again, "Be
    good to her."</p>

    <p>"I wull, I wull," burst from Malcolm in sobs; and he wailed
    aloud.</p>

    <p>The day wore on, and the afternoon came. Still Lady Florimel
    had not arrived, and still the marquis
    lingered.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>

    <p>As the gloom of the twilight was deepening into the early
    darkness of the winter night he opened wide his eyes, and was
    evidently listening. Malcolm could hear nothing, but the light
    in his master's face grew and the strain of his listening
    diminished. At length Malcolm became aware of the sound of
    wheels, which came rapidly nearer, till at last the carriage
    swung up to the hall-door. A moment, and Lady Florimel was
    flitting across the room.</p>

    <p>"Papa! papa!" she cried, and, throwing her arm over him,
    laid her cheek to his.</p>

    <p>The marquis could not return her embrace: he could only
    receive her into the depths of his shining, tearful eyes.</p>

    <p>"Flory!" he murmured, "I'm going away. I'm going&mdash;I've
    got&mdash;to make an&mdash;apology. Malcolm, be
    good&mdash;"</p>

    <p>The sentence remained unfinished. The light paled from his
    countenance: he had to carry it with him. He was dead.</p>

    <p>Lady Florimel gave a loud cry. Mrs. Courthope ran to her
    assistance. "My lady's in a dead faint," she whispered, and
    left the room to get help.</p>

    <p>Malcolm lifted Lady Florimel in his great arms and bore her
    tenderly to her own apartment. There he left her to the care of
    her women and returned to the chamber of death.</p>

    <p>Meantime, Mr. Graham and Mr. Soutar had come. When Malcolm
    re-entered the schoolmaster took him kindly by the arm and
    said, "Malcolm, there can be neither place nor moment fitter
    for the solemn communication I am commissioned to make to you:
    I have, as in the presence of your dead father, to inform you
    that you are now marquis of Lossie; and God forbid you should
    be less worthy as marquis than you have been as fisherman!"</p>

    <p>Malcolm stood stupefied. For a while he seemed to himself to
    be turning over in his mind something he had heard read from a
    book, with a nebulous notion of being somehow concerned in it.
    The thought of his father cleared his brain. He ran to the dead
    body, kissed its lips as he had once kissed the forehead of
    another, and falling on his knees wept, he knew not for what.
    Presently, however, he recovered himself, rose, and, rejoining
    the two men, said, "Gentlemen, hoo mony kens this turn o'
    things?"</p>

    <p>"None but Mr. Morrison, Mrs. Catanach and ourselves&mdash;so
    far as I know," answered Mr. Soutar.</p>

    <p>"And Miss Horn," added Mr. Graham, "She first brought out
    the truth of it, and ought to be the first to know of your
    recognition by your father."</p>

    <p>"I s' tell her mysel'," returned Malcolm. "But, gentlemen, I
    beg o' ye, till I ken what I'm aboot an' gie ye leave, dinna
    open yer moo' to leevin' cratur' aboot this. There's time
    eneuch for the warl' to ken 't."</p>

    <p>"Your lordship commands me," said Mr. Soutar.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Malcolm, until you give me leave," said Mr.
    Graham.</p>

    <p>"Whaur's Mr. Morrison?" asked Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"He is still in the house," said Mr. Soutar.</p>

    <p>"Gang till him, sir, an' gar him promise, on the word o' a
    gentleman, to haud his tongue. I canna bide to hae't blaret a'
    gait an' a' at ance. For Mistress Catanach, I s' deal wi' her
    mysel'."</p>

    <p>The door opened, and, in all the conscious dignity conferred
    by the immunities and prerogatives of her calling, Mrs.
    Catanach walked into the room.</p>

    <p>"A word wi' ye, Mistress Catanach," said Malcolm.</p>

    <p>"Certainly, my lord," answered the howdy with mingled
    presumption and respect, and followed him to the dining-room.
    "Weel, my lord&mdash;" she began, before he had turned from
    shutting the door behind them, in the tone and with the
    air&mdash;or rather <i>airs</i>&mdash;of having conferred a
    great benefit, and expecting its recognition.</p>

    <p>"Mistress Catanach," interrupted Malcolm, turning and facing
    her, "gien I be un'er ony obligation to you, it's frae anither
    tongue I maun hear't. But I hae an offer to mak ye: Sae lang as
    it disna coom oot 'at I'm onything better nor a fisherman born,
    ye s' hae yer twinty poun' i' the year, peyed ye quarterly.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> But the moment fowk says wha
       I am ye touch na a poun'-not' mair, an' I coont mysel' free
       to pursue onything I can pruv agane ye."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Catanach attempted a laugh of scorn, but her face was
    gray as putty and its muscles declined response.</p>

    <p>"<i>Ay</i> or <i>no</i>?" said Malcolm. "I winna gar ye
    sweir, for I wad lippen to yer aith no a hair."</p>

    <p>"Ay, my lord," said the howdy, reassuming at least outward
    composure, and with it her natural brass, for as she spoke she
    held out her open palm.</p>

    <p>"Na, na," said Malcolm, "nae forhan' payments. Three months
    o' tongue-haudin', an' there's yer five poun'; an' Maister
    Soutar o' Duff Harbor 'ill pay 't intill yer ain han'. But
    brack troth wi' me, an' ye s' hear o' 't; for gien ye war hangt
    the warl' wad be a' the cleaner. Noo quit the hoose, an' never
    lat me see ye aboot the place again. But afore ye gang I gie ye
    fair warnin' 'at I mean to win at a' yer byganes."</p>

    <p>The blood of red wrath was seething in Mrs. Catanach's face:
    she drew herself up and stood flaming before him, on the verge
    of explosion.</p>

    <p>"Gang frae the hoose," said Malcolm, "or I'll set the muckle
    hun' to shaw ye the gait."</p>

    <p>Her face turned the color of ashes, and with hanging cheeks
    and scared but not the less wicked eyes she hurried from the
    room. Malcolm watched her out of the house, then, following her
    into the town, brought Miss Horn back with him to aid in the
    last earthly services, and hastened to Duncan's cottage.</p>

    <p>But, to his amazement and distress, it was forsaken and the
    hearth cold. In his attendance on his father he had not seen
    the piper&mdash;he could not remember for how many days; and on
    inquiry he found that, although he had not been missed, no one
    could recall having seen him later than three or four days
    agone. The last he could hear of him was that about a week
    before a boy had spied him sitting on a rock in the Baillies'
    Barn with his pipes in his lap. Searching the cottage, he found
    that his broadsword and dirk, with all his poor finery, were
    gone.</p>

    <p>That same night Mrs. Catanach also disappeared.</p>

    <p>A week after, what was left of Lord Lossie was buried.
    Malcolm followed the hearse with the household. Miss Horn
    walked immediately behind him, on the arm of the schoolmaster.
    It was a great funeral, with a short road, for the body was
    laid in the church&mdash;close to the wall, just under the
    crusader with the Norman canopy.</p>

    <p>Lady Florimel wept incessantly for three days; on the fourth
    she looked out on the sea and thought it very dreary; on the
    fifth she found a certain gratification in hearing herself
    called the marchioness; on the sixth she tried on her mourning
    and was pleased; on the seventh she went with the funeral and
    wept again; on the eighth came Lady Bellair, who on the ninth
    carried her away.</p>

    <p>To Malcolm she had not spoken once.</p>

    <p>Mr. Graham left Portlossie.</p>

    <p>Miss Horn took to her bed for a week.</p>

    <p>Mr. Crathie removed his office to the House itself, took
    upon him the function of steward as well as factor, had the
    state-rooms dismantled, and was master of the place.</p>

    <p>Malcolm helped Stoat with the horses and did odd jobs for
    Mr. Crathie. From his likeness to the old marquis, as he was
    still called, the factor had a favor for him, firmly believing
    the said marquis to be his father and Mrs. Stewart his mother;
    and hence it came that he allowed him a key to the library.</p>

    <p>The story of Malcom's plans and what came of them requires
    another book.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"

    <h2>THE STAGE IN ITALY.</h2>

    <p>The Italians are undoubtedly the most theatre-loving people
    in the world. With them the play-house takes the place to a
    great extent of drawing-room and evening lounge. Almost every
    Italian family of any social position possesses a box at one of
    the principal theatres, where visits are received and many a
    scene from the <i>School for Scandal</i> is enacted whilst the
    fair gossip-mongers flirt and sip ices. In winter the opera is
    the standard amusement of the fashionable world, while the
    favorite resort in summer is the <i>diurno</i> or open air
    theatre, which is in the form of an amphitheatre, the stage
    with its accessories facing an unroofed enclosure, with the
    seats arranged in tiers one above another, and fenced off by an
    iron balustrade from a terrace which serves the purpose of a
    gallery. A vast covered corridor is nearly always to be found
    adjacent to the <i>diurno</i>, beneath which the audience can
    take refuge in case of a shower, walk between the acts and
    indulge in <i>bebite</i>&mdash;cooling drinks, such as sherbets
    and beer. The <i>abbonamento</i> (or subscription) to a diurno
    costs from three to ten dollars for the season of thirty or
    forty representations. When a dramatic company is about to
    visit a city the manager first secures his <i>abbonati</i>, for
    according to their number he is able to regulate his expenses,
    as he counts little on chance spectators, and is sure to have
    almost always to play before the same audience.</p>

    <p>The lyric stage in Italy takes precedence of the dramatic,
    and in the large cities, Milan, Venice, Genoa, Florence, Rome
    and Naples, the production of a new opera is considered a
    national event, forming for many days previous to its
    production the chief topic of conversation in salons and
    <i>caff&egrave;s</i>. No such enthusiasm is manifested in
    regard to the first representation of a new play; and although
    the house may be crowded and the author called before the
    curtain, he may deem himself happy if his drama is played four
    times during the season; whereas a popular opera will be given
    night after night for two months. An opera, if it has any
    merit, may be the means of carrying the fame of Italian genius
    to the farthest limits of the earth, but it is a chance if the
    comedy which pleases at Venice will be appreciated in the least
    degree at Rome or Naples, such are the variations in manners
    and customs, especially amongst the lower orders, between one
    Italian province and another. Hence, opera is greatly fostered
    and protected. There are a dozen musical <i>conservatori</i>,
    public and private, in each of the principal cities, for the
    training of singers, and prizes are accorded to them out of
    funds especially set apart for the purpose by the government,
    which also grants large annual subsidies to the leading lyric
    theatres, such as the Scala at Milan, the San Carlo at Naples,
    the Fenice at Venice, the Pergola at Florence, the Carlo Felice
    at Genoa, the Communale at Bologna, and the Apollo at Rome. The
    dramatic stage has none of these aids, the various companies
    have to pay their own expenses, and, whatever may be the merits
    of the artists who compose them, they scarcely ever obtain any
    special recognition from the government. Although the smallest
    Italian city possesses its theatre, and some of the
    capitals&mdash;Milan and Naples, for instance&mdash;at least a
    dozen, there is no training-school for the stage in any part of
    the country. Nor is there such an institution as the English
    Dramatic College, where decayed artists can retire when their
    day of glory is past and they have become poor and lonely. Each
    city has one theatre, the largest and most magnificent,
    reserved exclusively for operatic performances, and where the
    unmusical drama is scarcely ever tolerated. I once saw Ristori
    act in Metastasio's <i>Dido</i> at the Scala for the benefit of
    the wounded <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> during the war for Italian
       independence; but this was the only occasion in fifty years
       on which an actress had declaimed in that enormous edifice,
       and nothing but patriotic charity would have excused such an
       infringement of time-honored etiquette. When, therefore, the
       Italian opera-houses close for the season, they are never
       reopened for the accommodation of wandering "stars." The
       consequence of this is, that the drama is banished to the
       inferior theatres, and whilst thousands of francs are spent
       on the scenery of a new opera or ballet, the poor player has
       to content himself with an indifferent stage and wretched
       decorations. In short, to quote an observation made to me
       recently by Signor Salvini, "Theatrical affairs are just the
       opposite in Italy to what they are in America. In Italy the
       opera-bill is never changed more than three times in as many
       months: in America it varies almost every evening. In Italy
       the play-bill is renewed nightly, while in this country and
       in England a drama, if good, may have a run of over a
       hundred representations." Nothing surprised Salvini more
       during his stay in the United States than the splendor of
       the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> of some of the New York
       plays, but he accounted for it easily enough. The managers
       of most of the New York, Paris and London theatres do not
       hesitate to lavish large sums of money upon their
       decorations and scenery, because should the piece fail for
       which they were painted they can be used in some other. The
       Italian theatres are nearly always the property either of
       some nobleman or of a company of speculators, whose
       principal object is to make as much money out of them, and
       spend as little upon them, as possible. They are rented out
       for a month or so to one or other of the many troupes of
       actors which are constantly wandering about the country, and
       which bring their own scenery and dresses with them,
       generally of the cheapest and most tawdry description.</p>

    <p>A Tuscan proverb says, "<i>Figlio d'attore, attore</i>"
    ("The son of an actor is always an actor"); and this in Italy
    is pretty sure to be the case. The three greatest living
    actors, Salvini, Rossi and Majeroni, belong to families which
    have long been popular on the stage, and so do the actresses
    Ristori and Sedowsky. Signora Ristori made her d&eacute;but as
    an infant in the cradle, and was for years a member of a troupe
    the leading lady of which was her late mother, Signora
    Maddalena Ristori, a woman of great talent and merit, whose
    death at an advanced age has recently occasioned her celebrated
    daughter poignant grief. There still exists in Italy a Venetian
    troupe of comedians whose ancestors were the first interpreters
    of the comedies of Goldoni, and several of them claim descent
    from players who enacted the tragedies and comedies of serious
    classical literature before the courts of Lucrezia Borgia and
    Leonora d'Este. In glancing over an Italian play-bill one is
    invariably struck by the fact that many of the artists bear the
    same name, and are evidently connected by ties of consanguinity
    or of marriage. In the Ristori troupe, for instance, there are
    several actors calling themselves by the same name as that
    great artist, and who are doubtless of her family. The Salvini
    company embraces, besides the two brothers Tommaso and
    Alessandro, several Piamontis, two or three Piccininis and two
    Colonellos. I once knew in Italy a manager named Spada who
    directed a little troupe of buffo actors consisting of his
    grandfather and grandmother, father and mother, three or four
    uncles and aunts, two brothers, and one or two sisters, in
    addition to himself, his wife and children. Such facts are in
    part accounted for by the social status&mdash;or rather want of
    status&mdash;of the profession. Down to within a very recent
    period ecclesiastical censures weighed heavily upon all actors,
    and Christian burial was denied them unless during their final
    illness they had formally declared their intention to abandon
    the stage in case of recovery. So severe a condemnation on the
    part of the clergy naturally produced a strong prejudice
    against those who connected themselves in any way with the
    stage; and it is only recently that in Italy, a land where
    social changes are slow, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> doors of her somewhat formal
       society have been opened to admit even persons so
       distinguished in every sense of the word as are Ristori,
       Piamonti, Salvini and Rossi. The social unfriendliness of
       the audiences&mdash;who can applaud so enthusiastically that
       a stranger witnessing for the first time their noisy
       demonstrations would easily believe every man and woman in
       the theatre ready to die for the sake of the admired
       artist&mdash;is doubtless the cause of the patriarchal
       system observable in the formation of Italian dramatic
       companies. The members thereof prefer adopting their
       fathers' profession rather than enter another where they
       would be constantly mortified by being pointed at as the
       children of actors.</p>

    <p>A little research into the history of the stage in Italy
    will enlighten the reader as to the true cause both of the
    harsh condemnation of the Church and of the prejudice of
    society against this great profession. The plays of the old
    Romans were proverbially loose both in their plots and
    dialogues, and Juvenal has spoken of the actors of his time
    with the bitterest contempt. During the Middle Ages the members
    of the various religious confraternities monopolized the stage
    with their sacred dramas and mysteries, and the "profane
    stage," as an Italian writer calls it, was so degraded that
    more than once both the Church and State had to use their
    influence to put down performances which were too infamous to
    be here described. When the Renaissance came the drama was
    reinstated in the position it occupied during the days of Roman
    civilization, but the plays of this period were merely
    imitations of the Latin comedies; and if we may judge by the
    most celebrated of them which still exists&mdash;the
    <i>Mandragora</i> of Macchiavelli, for example&mdash;far
    exceeded their models in obscenity. When Benedict XIV. ascended
    the pontifical throne he established a severe censorship, and
    inaugurated the harsh system to which I have already alluded,
    with the effect of banishing immoral productions from the
    stage, though without improving its intellectual tone. In the
    eighteenth century Goldoni appeared and gave to the world his
    graceful comedies, which were followed by the lyric dramas of
    Metastasio and the lofty tragedies of Alfieri. Since then there
    has been a succession of able dramatists&mdash;Monti, Gozzi,
    Manzoni, Pellico, Ippolito d'Asti, etc.; and as the class of
    plays acted was elevated, so the character of the performers
    was also improved. From being dissolute they became generally
    respectable; and at present it may be safely asserted that a
    better-conducted, more frugal or industrious class of men and
    woman can scarcely be found than are the Italian players. That
    class of actresses with whom their profession is only a means
    of displaying their beauty and splendid but often ill-gotten
    robes and jewelry, is little known in Italy, Such persons would
    be scarcely tolerated either by their comrades or by the
    public. Indeed, although within the past few years, owing to
    the unsettled state of affairs, a great many plays of
    questionable morality have been acted, especially in Rome,
    still the tone of the performances usually witnessed in an
    Italian theatre is greatly above the average of what even
    Americans applaud; and a French play has to go through more
    careful pruning for the Italian stage than for ours.</p>

    <p>The Italian actors have always been in the habit of forming
    themselves into troupes, or, as they call them,
    <i>compagnie</i>, placed under the direction of one person, who
    is both manager and principal performer. They divide these
    troupes according to the various kinds of acting; thus, there
    are companies of tragic, melodramatic and comic actors, but it
    is very rare to find a combination of tragedy and comedy in the
    same entertainment. There are at present about eighty different
    troupes of actors in Italy, including those devoted to the
    marionnette and dialect performances. The principal are the
    "Salvini," "Ristori," "Majeroni," "Sedowsky," and "Rossi" for
    tragedy, the "Bellotti Bon" for high comedy, and the "De
    Mestri" for farce and vaudeville. The "Ristori," "Salvini" and
    "Rossi" troupes have been the round of the world.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> The "Bellotti Bon" has, I
       believe, never quitted Italy. It is a remarkable combination
       of well-trained actors, devoted exclusively to the
       representation of modern society plays and dramas, mostly
       translated or adapted from the French. Bellotti-Bon, the
       director, is not excelled in his own line even on the stage
       of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais. His company is
       rich, and its scenery and dresses are tasteful. The late
       Signora Cazzola, formerly the leading lady of this troupe,
       was perhaps the best high-comedy and dramatic actress Italy
       has produced. Signer Salvini informed me that Alexandre
       Dumas <i>fils</i> told him he preferred this lady's
       interpretation of the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Marguerite
       Gauthier (Camille) in <i>La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias</i> to
       that of Madame Doche, who created the part. She produced a
       great effect when the dying Camille looks at herself in the
       glass for the first time after her long illness. Instead of
       screaming or fainting, as is usual with most actresses who
       undertake the character, Signora Cazzola stood for a long
       time gazing intently at the havoc disease had wrought upon
       her lovely countenance. Then, with a deep sigh and an
       expression of intense agony, she turned the mirror with its
       back toward her, implying that she could never again endure
       the pain of seeing herself reflected upon its truth-telling
       surface. On the toilette-table was a vase full of
       camellias&mdash;those beautiful but scentless flowers which
       were emblematic of her brilliant but artificial life. Taking
       one of these in her hand, she plucked it to pieces leaf by
       leaf, and when the last petal fell to the ground went
       quietly back to her bed, there hopelessly to await the
       coming on of death. Her parting with Armand was very
       pathetic, and her death, although harrowing and true to
       Nature, was not revolting, its horrors being moderated by
       artistic good sense and delicacy. This great artiste died
       young, worn out by the strong emotions she not only
       represented, but actually felt.</p>

    <p>Signora Cazzola, together with Virginia Marini and Isolina
    Piamonti, was a pupil of Signor Salvini. Virginia Marini is
    well considered in Italy, and used to be the leading lady in
    the Salvini troupe. She now directs a company of her own, and
    has been succeeded in her former position by the estimable
    Signora Piamonti, whom Salvini declares to be one of the most
    versatile artistes he has ever known, equally good in the
    highest tragedy or the liveliest farce. Her Dalilla in
    <i>Samson</i> was much admired in America, but her rendering of
    the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Francesca di Rimini in the tragedy of
    that name is perhaps her greatest performance.</p>

    <p>Signora Sedowsky is undoubtedly the greatest tragic actress
    of Italy. She is perhaps less stately and grand than Ristori,
    but in fire and depth of feeling she greatly surpasses this
    eminent trag&eacute;dienne. Her Ph&egrave;dre is pronounced by
    excellent judges equal to that of Rachel. Signora Sedowsky was
    born at Naples, and is the proprietress of three large theatres
    in that city. She is the wife of a wealthy nobleman.
    Notwithstanding her rank, she still keeps on the stage, but is
    received with honor in the first society. She has never acted
    out of Italy, and very rarely beyond the walls of Naples.</p>

    <p>The superlative merits of Signora Ristori are so well known
    in America that the mere mention of her name is sure to recall
    some of the most delightful evenings ever spent by many of my
    readers. Her genius and beauty, her majesty and glorious method
    of declamation, have won her a foremost rank in her profession,
    and her virtues and nobility of conduct the esteem of all who
    have ever known her. There are indeed few women more estimable
    than Adelaide Ristori, Marchioness Capranica del Grillo. It may
    be a matter of surprise to some who are not aware of the fact
    when I tell them that in Italy Ristori is more famous in comedy
    than in tragedy. She is inimitable in such parts as the hostess
    in Goldoni's clever comedy of <i>La Locandiera</i>.</p>

    <p>Of all Italian actors, Gustavo Modena was the most renowned.
    He is to the stage of his native land what Garrick was to that
    of England, and his conception of the various parts in classic
    drama, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span> his "points," and even his
       dress, have become traditional, and are almost invariably
       retained by his followers. I never saw him act, but I once
       heard him recite in a private <i>salon</i> his famous
       <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Saul in Alfieri's tragedy of that name.
       In person he was tall and largely built, His countenance was
       not prepossessing, and, like Michael Angelo, he had a broken
       nose. His eye could assume a terrific aspect, and his voice
       was rich, powerful and varied in its tone. At times it
       rolled like thunder, while at other moments it was as soft
       and tender as the sweetest notes of a flute. Signor Modena
       died some years ago. He was the master of Salvini, and to
       him that illustrious actor does not hesitate to attribute
       much of his fame.</p>

    <p>Rossi, the only living rival of Salvini, is still a young
    man, and doubtless has great talents. I think him even more
    impetuous and ardent than Salvini, but he is less intellectual,
    and his elocution is decidedly inferior.</p>

    <p>Majeroni is an actor of the same school, but he is becoming
    old, and has a tendency to rant.</p>

    <p>Tommaso Salvini, our late visitor, is of Milanese parentage,
    and was born in the Lombard capital on January 1, 1830. His
    father, as I have already said, was an able actor, and his
    mother a popular actress named Guglielmina Zocchi. When quite a
    boy he showed a rare talent for acting, and performed in
    certain plays given during the Easter holidays in the school
    where he was educated, with such rare ability that his father
    determined to devote him to the stage. For this purpose he
    placed him under the tuition of the great Modena, who conceived
    much affection for him. The training received thus early from
    such able hands soon bore fruits, and before he was thirteen
    Salvini had already won a kind of renown in juvenile
    characters. At fifteen he lost both his parents, and the
    bereavement so preyed upon his spirits that he was obliged to
    abandon his career for two years, and returned once more under
    the tuition of Modena. When he again emerged from retirement he
    joined the Ristori troupe, and shared with that great actress
    many a triumph. In 1849, Salvini entered the army of Italian
    independence, and fought valiantly for the defence of his
    country, receiving in recognition of his services several
    medals of honor. Peace being proclaimed, he again appeared upon
    the stage in a company directed by Signer Cesare Dondini. He
    played in the <i>Edipo</i> of Nicolini&mdash;a tragedy written
    expressly for him&mdash;and achieved a great success. Next he
    appeared in Alfieri's <i>Saul</i>, and then all Italy declared
    that Modena's mantle had fallen on worthy shoulders. His fame
    was now prodigious, and wherever he went he was received with
    boundless enthusiasm. He visited Paris, where he played
    Orasmane, Orestes, Saul and Othello. On his return to Florence
    he was hospitably entertained by the marquis of Normanby, then
    English ambassador to the court of Tuscany, and this
    enlightened nobleman strongly encouraged him to extend his
    repertory of Shakespearian characters. In 1865 occurred the
    sixth centenary of Dante's birthday, and the four greatest
    Italian actors were invited to perform in Silvio Pellico's
    tragedy of <i>Francesca di Rimini</i>, which is founded on an
    episode in the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. The cast originally
    stood on the play-bills thus: Francesca, Signora Ristori;
    Lancelotto, Signor Rossi; Paulo, Signor Salvini; and Guido,
    Signor Majeroni. It happened, however, that Rossi, who was
    unaccustomed to play the part of Lancelotto, felt timid at
    appearing in a character so little suited to him. Hearing this,
    Signor Salvini, with exquisite politeness and good-nature,
    volunteered to take the insignificant part, relinquishing the
    grand <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Paulo to his junior in the
    profession. He created by the force of his genius an impression
    in the minor part which is still vivid in the minds of all who
    witnessed the performance. The government of Florence, grateful
    for his urbanity, presented him with a statuette of Dante, and
    King Victor Emmanuel rewarded him with the title of knight of
    the Order of the Saints Maurice and Lazarus. Later he received
    from the same monarch a diamond ring, with the rank of officer
    in the Order of the Crown
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> of Italy. In 1868, Signer
       Salvini visited Madrid, where his acting of the death of
       Conrad in <i>La Morte Civile</i> produced such an impression
       that the easily-excited Madrilese rushed upon the stage to
       ascertain whether the death was actual or fictitious. The
       queen, Isabella II., conferred upon the great actor many
       marks of favor, and so shortly afterward did King Louis of
       Portugal, who frequently entertained him at the royal palace
       of Lisbon.</p>

    <p>Signor Salvini's recent visit to America I need scarcely
    mention: its triumphs are still fresh in the memory of the
    public, and the only drawback to its complete success was the
    unhappy fact that the eminent artist did not appeal to his
    audiences in their own language.</p>

    <p>I know of nothing more remarkable than the difference which
    exists between the Salvini of the stage and the Salvini of
    private life, the one so imposing, impetuous and fiery, the
    other so gentle, urbane, and even retiring. He is a gentleman
    possessing the manners of the good old school&mdash;courtly and
    somewhat ceremonious, reminding one of those Italian nobles of
    the sixteenth century of whom we lead in the novels of Giraldo
    Cinthio and Fiorentino&mdash;<i>uomini illustri, e di civil
    costumi</i>. His greeting is cordial and his conversation
    delightful, full of anecdote and marked with enthusiasm for his
    art. When I first became acquainted with him I was of opinion
    that his interpretation of Hamlet was based only upon the
    translated text, but in the course of a very long conversation
    on the subject I discovered that he was well acquainted
    (through literal translations) not only with the text, but also
    with the notes and comments of our leading critics. In speaking
    of the part in which he is altogether unrivaled he said, "I am
    of opinion that Shakespeare intended Othello to be a Moor of
    Barbary or some other part of Northern Africa, of whom there
    were many in Italy during the sixteenth century. I have met
    several, and think I imitate their ways and manners pretty
    well. You are aware, however, that the historical Othello was
    not a black at all. He was a white man, and a Venetian general
    named Mora. His history resembles that of Shakespeare's hero in
    many particulars. Giraldo Cinthio, probably for better effect,
    made out of the name Mora, <i>moro</i>, a blackamoor; and
    Shakespeare, unacquainted with the true story, followed this
    old novelist's lead; and it was well he did so, for have we not
    in consequence the most perfect delineation of the
    peculiarities of Moorish temperament ever conceived?" The
    costumes worn by Salvini in this play are copied from those
    depicted in certain Venetian pictures of the fifteenth century
    in which several Moorish officers appear. It took him many
    years to master this <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, and he assured me he
    could not play it more than three times in succession without
    experiencing terrible fatigue. "It is a matter of wonder to
    me," he observed, "that English actors can play a great
    character like this so many nights in succession; and, above
    all, that they retain self-possession whilst the fidgety noise
    of scene-shifting is going on behind them. To avoid this, I
    have been obliged to cut <i>Othello</i> into six acts, and to
    make many changes in <i>Hamlet</i>." The intensity of feeling
    with which he throws himself into the part he is representing
    was especially evident on the occasion of his playing Saul.
    After the performance I was invited to go behind the scenes to
    speak with him, and was surprised as well as pained to find him
    utterly exhausted. I could not help saying, "How can you exert
    yourself thus to please so few people?" There were scarcely
    four hundred persons assembled to see this sublime performance.
    He answered with honest simplicity, "They have paid their
    money, and are entitled to the best I can do for them; besides
    that, when I am on the stage I forget the world and all that is
    in it, and live the character I represent." "You will," said I,
    "make a grand Lear." "Yes," he replied, "I think I shall be
    able to make something out of the old king. I have been reading
    the tragedy for some time, but it will still take me two years
    to study it thoroughly."</p>

    <p>Salvini related to me several anecdotes which show how quick
    he is to master <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> any difficulties accident
       throws in his way. "Once I bought," he said, "a play of a
       poor young writer which I thought I could make something of;
       but when we came to rehearse it for the last time before
       representation, it seemed to me utterly flat and
       unprofitable. The piece was called <i>La Suonatrice
       d'Arpa</i> ('The Harp-Girl'). The actors all said the last
       act was so stupid that we should make a <i>fiasco</i>. I at
       last hit upon an idea. We had, however, only a few hours to
       execute it in. I changed the story: instead of the play
       ending happily, I made the father kill his daughter
       accidentally, and then die of grief. All the dialogue had to
       be improvised by the leading actress and myself. I played
       the father, and Signora Piamonti the daughter. Such was the
       success of our invention that the piece was played eight
       nights in succession, and a rival actor, hearing of the
       triumph achieved by <i>The Harp-Girl</i>, bought from the
       author for a handsome sum the privilege of acting it in
       certain districts which were not included in my purchase of
       the drama. Not being aware of the alterations we had made,
       and performing it according to the letter of the text, he
       made <i>un fiasco solenne</i>&mdash;a dead failure."</p>

    <p>After the first performance of <i>Za&iuml;re</i> I took the
    liberty of observing to Salvini that a superb piece of
    "business" which marks his acting in the last act was not to be
    found in the text. "Oh," he replied, "I will tell you the
    origin of it. I was playing at Naples, and one night, when I
    threw the body of my murdered wife upon the ottoman in the last
    act, my burnouse fell off and fixed itself to my waist like a
    tail. I saw at once that if I was not careful I should provoke
    laughter, and instantly imagined that I would pretend to
    believe the clinging drapery was the wounded Za&iuml;re
    grasping me behind. I appeared to dread even to look round,
    lest I should encounter her pallid face. I hesitated, I
    trembled, and when with a supreme effort I at last grasped the
    burnouse and cast it from me, I still lacked the courage to
    ascertain what it really was, and stood shivering before the
    white heap it made upon the floor. Finally, just as I thought
    public curiosity to know what I was going to do began to grow
    weary, I stooped down and seizing the white mantle dashed it
    from me with contempt, showing by the gesture that I had
    discovered what it was, and felt anger that such a trifle
    should thus alarm a bold man who had committed murder." This
    pantomime obtained for Salvini at the New York Academy of Music
    one of his greatest ovations.</p>

    <p>When asked why he did not learn English, "Ah!" he replied,
    "I am too old; and even if I mastered it, I could not control
    my knowledge of it. When excited I should be lapsing into
    Italian, which would be very absurd. You asked me the other day
    why I do not play Orestes. I should make a queer young Greek
    with an Apollo-like figure now-a-days! The time was when I
    looked the part and acted it well, and then I liked to play it.
    I must leave it, with many other good things, to younger men."
    Speaking about dramatic elocution, he said, "The best method is
    obtained by close observation of Nature, and above all by
    earnestness. If you can impress people with the conviction that
    you feel what you say, they will pardon many shortcomings. And,
    above all, study, study, study! All the genius in the world
    will not help you along with any art unless you become a hard
    student. It has taken me years to master a single part."</p>

    <p>Salvini's visit to America has been fruitful of a double
    good. He has shown forth the splendor of Italian genius, even
    revealing to us new marvels in that mine of wealth, the works
    of the greatest Bard of the English-speaking race; and he has
    gone back to Italy to tell her people of things he has seen in
    the New World which his great compatriot discovered&mdash;as
    wonderful in their way as any related by Othello to Desdemona's
    willing ear.</p>

    <h2>THREE FEATHERS.</h2>

    <h3>BY WILLIAM BLACK, AUTHOR OF "A PRINCESS OF THULE."</h3>

    <h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>

    <h3>TINTAGEL'S WALLS.</h3>

    <p>What was the matter with Harry Trelyon? His mother could not
    make out; and there never had been much confidence between
    them, so that she did not care to ask. But she watched, and she
    saw that he had, for the time at least, forsaken his accustomed
    haunts and ways and become gloomy, silent and self-possessed.
    Dick was left neglected in the stables: you no longer heard his
    rapid clatter along the highway, with the not over-melodious
    voice of his master singing "The Men of Merry, Merry England"
    or "The Young Chevalier." The long and slender fishing-rod
    remained on the pegs in the hall, although you could hear the
    flop of the small burn-trout of an evening when the flies were
    thick over the stream. The dogs were deprived of their
    accustomed runs; the horses had to be taken out for exercise by
    the groom; and the various and innumerable animals about the
    place missed their doses of alternate petting and teasing, all
    because Master Harry had chosen to shut himself up in his
    study.</p>

    <p>The mother of the young man very soon discovered that her
    son was not devoting his hours of seclusion in that
    extraordinary museum of natural history to making trout-flies,
    stuffing birds and arranging pinned butterflies in cases, as
    was his custom. These were not the occupations which now kept
    Master Harry up half the night. When she went in of a morning,
    before he was up, she found that he had been covering whole
    sheets of paper with careful copying out of passages taken at
    random from the volumes beside him. A Latin grammar was
    ordinarily on the table&mdash;a book which the young gentleman
    had brought back from school free from thumb-marks.
    Occasionally a fencing-foil lay among these evidences of study,
    while the small aquaria, the cases of stuffed animals with
    fancy backgrounds and the numerous bird-cages had been thrust
    aside to give fair elbow-room.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps," said Mrs. Trelyon to herself with much
    satisfaction&mdash;"perhaps, after all, that good little girl
    has given him a hint about Parliament, and he is preparing
    himself."</p>

    <p>A few days of this seclusion, however, began to make the
    mother anxious; and so one morning she went into his room. He
    hastily turned over the sheet of paper on which he had been
    writing: then he looked up, not too well pleased.</p>

    <p>"Harry, why do you stay in-doors on such a beautiful
    morning? It is quite like summer."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I know," he said. "I suppose we shall soon have a
    batch of parsons here: summer always brings them. They come out
    with the hot weather&mdash;like butterflies."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Trelyon was shocked and disappointed: she thought Wenna
    Rosewarne had cured him of his insane dislike to
    clergymen&mdash;indeed, for many a day gone by he had kept
    respectfully silent on the subject.</p>

    <p>"But we shall not ask them to come if you'd rather not," she
    said, wishing to do all she could to encourage the reformation
    of his ways. "I think Mr. Barnes promised to visit us early in
    May, but he is only one."</p>

    <p>"And one is worse than a dozen. When there's a lot you can
    leave 'em to fight it out among themselves. But one!&mdash;to
    have one stalking about an empty house, like a ghost dipped in
    ink! Why can't you ask anybody but clergymen, mother? There are
    whole lots of people would like to run down from London for a
    fortnight before getting into the thick of the season: there's
    the Pomeroy girls as good as offered to come."</p>

    <p>"But they can't come by themselves," Mrs. Trelyon said with
    a feeble protest.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, they can: they're ugly enough
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span> to be safe anywhere. And why
       don't you get Juliott up? She'll be glad to get away from
       that old curmudgeon for a week. And you ought to ask the
       Trewhellas, father and daughter, to dinner: that old fellow
       is not half a bad sort of fellow, although he's a
       clergyman."</p>

    <p>"Harry," said his mother, interrupting him, "I'll fill the
    house if that will please you; and you shall ask just
    whomsoever you please."</p>

    <p>"All right," said he: "the place wants waking up."</p>

    <p>"And then," said the mother, wishing to be still more
    gracious, "you might ask Miss Rosewarne to dine with us: she
    might come well enough, although Mr. Roscorla is not here."</p>

    <p>A sort of gloom fell over the young man's face again: "I
    can't ask her&mdash;you may if you like."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Trelyon stared: "What is the matter, Harry? Have you
    and she quarreled? Why, I was going to ask you, if you were
    down in the village to-day, to say that I should like to see
    her."</p>

    <p>"And how could I take such a message?" the young man said,
    rather warmly, "I don't see why the girl should be ordered up
    to see you as if you were conferring a favor on her by joining
    in this scheme. She's very hard-worked; you have got plenty of
    time; you ought to call on her and study her convenience,
    instead of making her trot all the way up here whenever you
    want to talk to her."</p>

    <p>The pale and gentle woman flushed a little, but she was
    anxious not to give way to petulance just then: "Well, you are
    quite right, Harry: it was thoughtless of me. I should like to
    go down and see her this morning; but I have sent Jakes over to
    the blacksmith's, and I am afraid of that new lad."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I will drive you down to the inn. I suppose among them
    they can put the horses to the wagonette," the young man said,
    not very graciously: and then Mrs. Trelyon went off to get
    ready.</p>

    <p>It was a beautiful, fresh morning, the far-off line of the
    sea still and blue, the sunlight lighting up the wonderful
    masses of primroses along the tall banks, the air sweet with
    the resinous odor of the gorse. Mrs. Trelyon looked with a
    gentle and childlike pleasure on all these things, and was
    fairly inclined to be very friendly with the young gentleman
    beside her. But he was more than ordinarily silent and morose.
    Mrs. Trelyon knew she had done nothing to offend him, and
    thought it hard she should be punished for the sins of anybody
    else.</p>

    <p>He spoke scarcely a word to her as the carriage rolled along
    the silent highways. He drove rapidly and carelessly down the
    steep thoroughfare of Eglosilyan, although there were plenty of
    loose stones about. Then he pulled sharply up in front of the
    inn, and George Rosewarne appeared.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Rosewarne, let me introduce you to my mother. She wants
    to see Miss Wenna for a few moments, if she is not
    engaged."</p>

    <p>Mr. Rosewarne took off his cap, assisted Mrs. Trelyon to
    alight, and then showed her the way into the house.</p>

    <p>"Won't you come in, Harry?" his mother said.</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>A man had come out to the horses' heads.</p>

    <p>"You leave 'em alone," said the young gentleman: "I sha'n't
    get down."</p>

    <p>Mabyn came out, her bright young face full of pleasure.</p>

    <p>"How do you do, Mabyn?" he said coldly, and without offering
    to shake hands.</p>

    <p>"Won't you come in for a minute?" she said, rather
    surprised.</p>

    <p>"No, thank you. Don't you stay out in the cold: you've got
    nothing round your neck."</p>

    <p>Mabyn went away without saying a word, but thinking that the
    coolness of the air was much less apparent than that of his
    manner and speech.</p>

    <p>Being at length left to himself, he turned his attention to
    the horses before him, and eventually, to pass the time, took
    out his pocket-handkerchief and began to polish the silver on
    the handle of the whip. He was disturbed in this peaceful
    occupation by a very timid voice, which said, "Mr. Trelyon." He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> turned round and found that
       Wenna's wistful face was looking up to him, with a look in
       it partly of friendly gladness and partly of anxiety and
       entreaty. "Mr. Trelyon," she said, with her eyes cast down,
       "I think you are offended with me. I am very sorry: I beg
       your forgiveness."</p>

    <p>The reins were fastened up in a minute, and he was down in
    the road beside her. "Now look here, Wenna," he said. "What
    could you mean by treating me so unfairly? I don't mean in
    being vexed with me, but in shunting me off, as it were,
    instead of having it out at once. I don't think it was
    fair."</p>

    <p>"I am very sorry," she said. "I think I was very wrong, but
    you don't know what a girl feels about such things. Will you
    come into the inn?"</p>

    <p>"And leave my horses? No," he said, good-naturedly. "But as
    soon as I get that fellow out, I will; so you go in at once,
    and I'll follow you directly. And mind, Wenna, don't you be so
    silly again, or you and I may have a real quarrel; and I know
    that would break your heart."</p>

    <p>The old pleased smile lit up her face again as she turned
    and went in-doors: he meanwhile proceeded to summon a hostler
    by shouting his name at the pitch of his voice.</p>

    <p>The small party of women assembled in the parlor were a
    trifle embarrassed: it was the first time that the great lady
    of the neighborhood had honored the inn with a visit. She
    herself was merely quiet, gentle and pleased, but Mrs.
    Rosewarne, with her fine eyes and her sensitive face all lit up
    and quickened by, the novel excitement, was all anxiety to
    amuse and interest and propitiate her distinguished guest.
    Mabyn, too, was rather shy and embarrassed: she said things
    hastily, and then seemed afraid of her interference. Wenna was
    scarcely at her ease, because she saw that her mother and
    sister were not; and she was very anxious, moreover, that these
    two should think well of Mrs. Trelyon and be disposed to like
    her.</p>

    <p>The sudden appearance of a man with a man's rough ways and
    loud voice seemed to shake these feminine elements better
    together, and to clear the air of timid apprehensions and
    cautions. Harry Trelyon came into the room with quite a marked
    freshness and good-nature on his face. His mother was
    surprised: what had completely changed his manner in a couple
    of minutes?</p>

    <p>"How are you, Mrs. Rosewarne?" he cried in his off-hand
    fashion. "You oughtn't to be in-doors on such a morning, or we
    shall never get you well, you know; and the doctor will be
    sending you to Penzance or Devonport for a change. Well, Mabyn,
    have you convinced anybody yet that your farm-laborers with
    their twelve shillings a week are better off than the
    slate-workers with their eighteen? You'd better take your
    sister's opinion on that point, and don't squabble with me.
    Mother, what's the use of sitting here? You bring Miss Wenna
    with you into the wagonette, and talk to her there about all
    your business-affairs, and I'll take you for a drive. Come
    along. And of course I want somebody with me: will you come,
    Mrs. Rosewarne, or will Mabyn? You can't?&mdash;then Mabyn
    must. Go along, Mabyn, and put your best hat on, and make
    yourself uncommonly smart, and you shall be allowed to sit next
    the driver&mdash;that's me."</p>

    <p>And indeed he bundled the whole of them about until they
    were seated in the wagonette just as he had indicated; and away
    they went from the inn-door.</p>

    <p>"And you think you are coming back in half an hour?" he said
    to his companion, who was much pleased and very proud to occupy
    such a place. "Oh no, you're not. You're a young and simple
    thing, Mabyn. These two behind us will go on talking now for
    any time about yards of calico and crochet-needles and twopenny
    subscriptions, while you and I, don't you see, are quietly
    driving them over to Tintagel&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, Mr. Trelyon!" said Mabyn.</p>

    <p>"You keep quiet. That isn't the half of what's going to
    befall you. I shall put up the horses at the inn, and I shall
    take you all down to the beach for a scramble to improve your
    appetite; and at the said inn you shall have luncheon with me,
    if you're all very good and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> behave yourselves. Then we
       shall drive back just when we particularly please. Do you
       like the picture?"</p>

    <p>"It is delightful: oh, I am sure Wenna will enjoy it," Mabyn
    said. "But don't you think, Mr. Trelyon, that you might ask her
    to sit here? One sees better here than sitting sideways in a
    wagonette."</p>

    <p>"They have their business-affairs to settle."</p>

    <p>"Yes," said Mabyn petulantly, "that is what every one says:
    nobody expects Wenna ever to have a moment's enjoyment to
    herself. Oh, here is old Uncle Cornish&mdash;he's a great
    friend of Wenna's: he will be dreadfully hurt if she passes him
    without saying a word."</p>

    <p>"Then we shall pull up and address Uncle Cornish. I believe
    he used to be the most thieving old ruffian of a poacher in
    this county."</p>

    <p>There was a hale old man of seventy or so seated on a low
    wall in front of one of the gardens, his face shaded from the
    sunlight by a broad hat, his lean gray hands employed in
    buckling up the leathern leggings that encased his spare
    calves. He got up when the horses stopped, and looked in rather
    a dazed fashion at the carriage.</p>

    <p>"How do you do this morning, Mr. Cornish?" Wenna said.</p>

    <p>"Why, now, to be sure!" the old man said, as if reproaching
    his own imperfect vision. "'Tis a fine marnin', Miss Wenna, and
    y&uuml; be agwoin' for a drive."</p>

    <p>"And how is your daughter-in-law, Mr. Cornish? Has she sold
    the pig yet?"</p>

    <p>"Naw, she hasn't sold the peg. If y&uuml; be agwoin'
    thr&uuml; Trevalga, Miss Wenna, just y&uuml; stop and have a
    look at that peg: y&uuml;'ll be 'mazed to see en. 'Tis many a
    year agone sence there has been such a peg by me. And perhaps
    y&uuml;'d take the laste bit o' refrashment, Miss Wenna, as
    y&uuml; go by: Jane would get y&uuml; a coop o' tay to
    once."</p>

    <p>"Thank you, Mr. Cornish, I'll look in and see the pig some
    other time: to-day we sha'n't be going as far as Trevalga."</p>

    <p>"Oh, won't you?" said Master Harry in a low voice as he
    drove on. "You'll be in Trevalga before you know where you
    are."</p>

    <p>Which was literally the case. Wenna was so much engaged in
    her talk with Mrs. Trelyon that she did not notice how far away
    they were getting from Eglosilyan; but Mabyn and her companion
    knew. They were now on the high uplands by the coast, driving
    between the beautiful banks, which were starred with primroses
    and stitchwort and red dead-nettle and a dozen other bright and
    tender-hued firstlings of the year. The sun was warm on the
    hedges and the fields, but a cool breeze blew about these lofty
    heights, and stirred Mabyn's splendid masses of hair as they
    drove rapidly along. Far over on their right, beyond the
    majestic wall of cliff, lay the great blue plain of the sea;
    and there stood the bold brown masses of the Sisters Rocks,
    with a circle of white foam round their base. As they looked
    down into the south the white light was so fierce that they
    could but faintly discern objects through it; but here and
    there they caught a glimpse of a square church-tower or of a
    few rude cottages clustered on the high plain, and these seemed
    to be of a transparent gray in the blinding glare of the
    sun.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly in front of them they found a deep chasm, with
    the white road leading down through its cool shadows. There was
    the channel of a stream, with the rocks looking purple amid the
    gray bushes; and here were rich meadows, with cattle standing
    deep in the grass and the daisies; and over there, on the other
    side, a strip of forest, with the sunlight shining along one
    side of the tall and dark-green pines. As they drove down into
    this place, which is called the Rocky Valley, a magpie rose
    from one of the fields and flew up into the firs.</p>

    <p>"That is sorrow," said Mabyn.</p>

    <p>Another one rose and flew up to the same spot.</p>

    <p>"And that is joy," she said, with her face brightening.</p>

    <p>"Oh, but I saw another as we came to the brow of the hill,
    and that means a marriage," her companion remarked to
    her.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

    <p>"Oh no," she said quite eagerly, "I am sure there was no
    third one: I am certain there were only two. I am quite
    positive we only saw two."</p>

    <p>"But why should you be so anxious?" Trelyon said, "You know
    you ought to be looking forward to a marriage, and that is
    always a happy thing. Are you envious, Mabyn?"</p>

    <p>The girl was silent for a moment or two. Then she said, with
    a sudden bitterness in her tone, "Isn't it a fearful thing to
    have to be civil to people whom you hate? Isn't it, when they
    come and establish a claim on you through some one you care
    for? You look at them&mdash;yes, you can look at them&mdash;and
    you've got to see them kiss some one that you love; and you
    wonder she doesn't rush away for a bit of caustic and cauterize
    the place, as you do when a mad dog bites you."</p>

    <p>"Mabyn," said the young man beside her, "you are a most
    unchristian sort of person this morning. Who is it you hate in
    such a fashion? Will you take the reins while I walk up the
    hill?"</p>

    <p>Mabyn's little burst of passion still burned in her cheeks
    and gave a proud and angry look to her mouth, but she took the
    reins all the same, and her companion leapt to the ground. The
    banks on each side of the road going up this hill were tall and
    steep: here and there great masses of wild flowers were
    scattered among the grass and the gorse. From time to time he
    stopped to pick up a handful, until, when they had got up to
    the high and level country again, he had brought together a
    very pretty bouquet of wild blossoms. When he got into his seat
    and took the reins again he carelessly gave the bouquet to
    Mabyn.</p>

    <p>"Oh, how pretty!" she said; and then she turned round:
    "Wenna, are you very much engaged? Look at the pretty bouquet
    Mr. Trelyon has gathered for you."</p>

    <p>Wenna's quiet face flushed with pleasure when she took the
    flowers, and Mrs. Trelyon looked pleased and said they were
    very pretty. She evidently thought that her son was greatly
    improved in his manners when he condescended to gather flowers
    to present to a girl. Nay, was he not at this moment devoting a
    whole forenoon of his precious time to the unaccustomed task of
    taking ladies for a drive? Mrs. Trelyon regarded Wenna with a
    friendly look, and began to take a greater liking than ever to
    that sensitive and expressive face and to the quiet and earnest
    eyes.</p>

    <p>"But, Mr. Trelyon," said Wenna, looking round, "hadn't we
    better turn? We shall be at Trevenna directly."</p>

    <p>"Yes, you are quite right," said Master Harry: "you will be
    at Trevenna directly, and you are likely to be there for some
    time. For Mabyn and I have resolved to have luncheon there, and
    we are going down to Tintagel, and we shall most likely climb
    to King Arthur's Castle. Have you any objections?"</p>

    <p>Wenna had none. The drive through the cool and bright day
    had braced up her spirits. She was glad to know that everything
    looked promising about this scheme of hers. So she willingly
    surrendered herself to the holiday, and in due time they drove
    into the odd and remote little village and pulled up in front
    of the inn.</p>

    <p>So soon as the hostler had come to the horses' heads the
    young gentleman who had been driving jumped down and assisted
    his three companions to alight: then he led the way into the
    inn. In the doorway stood a stranger, probably a commercial
    traveler, who, with his hands in his pockets, his legs apart
    and a cigar in his mouth, had been visiting those three ladies
    with a very hearty stare as they got out of the carriage.
    Moreover, when they came to the doorway he did not budge an
    inch nor did he take his cigar from his mouth; and so, as it
    had never been Mr. Trelyon's fashion to sidle past any one,
    that young gentleman made straight for the middle of the
    passage, keeping his shoulders very square. The consequence was
    a collision. The imperturbable person with his hands in his
    pockets was sent staggering against the wall, while his cigar
    dropped on the stone. "What the devil&mdash;!" he was beginning
    to say, when Trelyon got the three women past him and into the
    small parlor. Then he went back: "Did you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> wish to speak to me, sir?
       No, you didn't: I perceive you are a prudent person. Next
       time ladies pass you, you'd better take your cigar out of
       your mouth or somebody'll destroy that two-pennyworth of
       tobacco for you. Good-morning."</p>

    <p>Then he returned to the little parlor, to which a waitress
    had been summoned: "Now, Jinny, pull yourself together and
    let's have something nice for luncheon&mdash;in an hour's time,
    sharp. You will, won't you? And how about that Sillery with the
    blue star&mdash;not the stuff with the gold head that some
    abandoned ruffian in Plymouth brews in his back garden. Well,
    can't you speak?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir," said the bewildered maid.</p>

    <p>"That's a good thing&mdash;a very good thing," said he,
    putting the shawls together on a sofa. "Don't you forget how to
    speak until you get married. And don't let anybody come into
    this room. And you can let my man have his dinner and a pint of
    beer. Oh, I forgot: I'm my own man this morning, so you needn't
    go asking for him. Now, will you remember all these
    things?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir; but what would you like for luncheon?"</p>

    <p>"My good girl, we should like a thousand things such as
    Tintagel never saw, but what you've got to do is to give us the
    nicest things you've got: do you see? I leave it entirely in
    your hands. Come along, young people."</p>

    <p>And so he bundled his charges out again into the main street
    of the village; and somehow it happened that Mabyn addressed a
    timid remark to Mrs. Trelyon, and that Mrs. Trelyon, in
    answering it, stopped for a moment; so that Master Harry was
    sent to Wenna's side, and these two led the way down the wide
    thoroughfare. There were few people visible in the
    old-fashioned place: here and there an aged crone came out to
    the door of one of the rude stone cottages to look at the
    strangers. Overhead the sky was veiled over with a thin fleece
    of white cloud, but the light was intense for all that, and
    indeed the colors of the objects around seemed all the more
    clear and marked.</p>

    <p>"Well, Miss Wenna," said the young man gayly, "how long are
    we to remain good friends? What is the next fault you will have
    to find with me? Or have you discovered something wrong
    already?"</p>

    <p>"Oh no," she said with a quiet smile, "I am very good
    friends with you this morning. You have pleased your mother
    very much by bringing her for this drive."</p>

    <p>"Oh, nonsense!" he said. "She might have as many drives as
    she chose; but presently you'll find a lot of those parsons
    back at the house, and she'll take to her white gowns again,
    and the playing of the organ all the day long, and all that
    sham stuff. I tell you what it is: she never seems alive, she
    never seems to take any interest in anything, unless you're
    with her. Now, you will see how the novelty of this
    luncheon-party in an inn will amuse her; but do you think she
    would care for it if she and I were here alone?"</p>

    <p>"Perhaps you never tried?" Miss Wenna said gently.</p>

    <p>"Perhaps I knew she wouldn't come. However, don't let's have
    a fight, Wenna: I mean to be very civil to you to-day&mdash;I
    do, really."</p>

    <p>"I am so much obliged to you," she said meekly. "But pray
    don't give yourself unnecessary trouble."</p>

    <p>"Oh," said he, "I'd always be civil to you if you would
    treat me decently. But you say far more rude things than I
    do&mdash;in that soft way, you know, that looks as if it were
    all silk and honey. I do think you've awfully little
    consideration for human failings. If one goes wrong in the
    least thing, even in one's spelling, you say something that
    sounds as pleasant as possible, and all the same it transfixes
    one just as you stick a pin through a beetle. You are very
    hard, you are&mdash;mean with those who would like to be
    friends with you. When it's mere strangers and cottagers and
    people of that sort, who don't care a brass farthing about you,
    then I believe you're all gentleness and kindness; but to your
    real friends the edge of a saw is smooth compared to you."</p>

    <p>"Am I so very harsh to my friends?" the young lady said in a
    resigned way.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>

    <p>"Oh, well," he said, with some compunction, "I don't quite
    say that, but you could be much more pleasant if you liked, and
    a little more charitable to their faults. You know there are
    some who would give a great deal to win your approval; and
    perhaps when you find fault they are so disappointed that they
    think your words are sharper than you mean; and sometimes they
    think you might give them credit for trying to please you, at
    least."</p>

    <p>"And who are these persons?" Wenna said, with another smile
    stealing over her face.</p>

    <p>"Oh," said he rather shamefacedly, "there's no need to
    explain anything to you: you always see it before one need put
    it in words."</p>

    <p>Well, perhaps it was in his manner or in the tone of his
    voice that there was something which seemed at this moment to
    touch her deeply, for she half turned and looked up at his face
    with her honest and earnest eyes, and said to him kindly, "Yes,
    I do know without you telling me; and it makes me happy to hear
    you talk so; and if I am unjust to you, you must not think it
    intentional. And I shall try not to be so in the future."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Trelyon was regarding with a kindly look the two young
    people walking on in front of her. Whatever pleased her son
    pleased her, and she was glad to see him enjoy himself in so
    light-hearted a fashion. These two were chatting to each other
    in the friendliest manner: sometimes they stopped to pick up
    wild flowers: they were as two children together under the fair
    and light summer skies.</p>

    <p>They went down and along a narrow valley, until they
    suddenly stood in front of the sea, the green waters of which
    were breaking in upon a small and lonely creek. What strange
    light was this that fell from the white skies above, rendering
    all the objects around them sharp its outline and intense in
    color? The beach before them seemed of a pale lilac, where the
    green waves broke in a semicircle of white. On their right some
    masses of ruddy rock jutted out into the cold sea, and there
    were huge black caverns into which the waves dashed and roared.
    On their left and far above them towered a great and isolated
    rock, its precipitous sides scored here and there with twisted
    lines of red and yellow quartz; and on the summit of this bold
    headland, amid the dark green of the sea-grass, they could see
    the dusky ruins&mdash;the crumbling walls and doorways and
    battlements&mdash;of the castle that is named in all the
    stories of King Arthur and his knights. The bridge across to
    the mainland has, in the course of centuries, fallen away, but
    there, on the other side of the wide chasm, were the ruins of
    the other portions of the castle, scarcely to be distinguished
    in parts from the grass-grown rocks. How long ago was it since
    Sir Tristram rode out here to the end of the world, to find the
    beautiful Isoulde awaiting him&mdash;she whom he had brought
    from Ireland as an unwilling bride to the old king Mark? And
    what of the joyous company of knights and ladies who once held
    high sport in the courtyard there? Trelyon, looking shyly at
    his companion, could see that her eyes seemed centuries away
    from him. She was quite unconscious of his covertly staring at
    her, for she was absently looking at the high and bare
    precipices, the deserted slopes of dark sea-grass and the
    lonely and crumbling ruins. She was wondering whether the
    ghosts of those vanished people ever came back to this lonely
    headland, where they would find the world scarcely altered
    since they had left it. Did they come at night, when the land
    was dark, and when there was a light over the sea only coming
    from the stars? If one were to come at night alone, and to sit
    down here by the shore, might not one see strange things far
    overhead or hear some sound other than the falling of the
    waves?</p>

    <p>"Miss Wenna," he said&mdash;and she started
    suddenly&mdash;"are you bold enough to climb with me up to the
    castle? I know my mother would rather stay here."</p>

    <p>She went with him mechanically. She followed him up the rude
    steps cut in the steep slopes of slate, holding his hand where
    that was possible, but her head was so full of dreams that she
    answered <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span> him when he spoke only with
       a vague yes or no. When they descended again they found that
       Mabyn had taken Mrs. Trelyon down to the beach, and had
       inveigled her into entering a huge cavern, or rather a
       natural tunnel, that went right through underneath the
       promontory on which the castle is built. They were in a sort
       of green-hued twilight, a scent of seaweed filling the damp
       air, and their voices raising an echo in the great hall of
       rock.</p>

    <p>"I hope the climbing has not made you giddy," Mrs. Trelyon
    said in her kind way to Wenna, noticing that she was very
    silent and distrait.</p>

    <p>"Oh no," Mabyn said promptly. "She has been seeing ghosts.
    We always know when Wenna has been seeing ghosts: she remains
    so for hours."</p>

    <p>And, indeed, at this time she was rather more reserved than
    usual all during their walk back to luncheon and while they
    were in the inn; and yet she was obviously very happy, and
    sometimes even amused by the childlike pleasure which Mrs.
    Trelyon seemed to obtain from these unwonted experiences.</p>

    <p>"Come, now, mother," Master Harry said, "what are you going
    to do for me when I come of age next month? Fill the house with
    guests&mdash;yes, you promised that&mdash;with not more than
    one parson to the dozen? And when they're all feasting and
    gabbling, and missing the targets with their arrows, you'll
    slip quietly away, and I'll drive you and Miss Wenna over here,
    and you'll go and get your feet wet again in that cavern, and
    you'll come up here again and have an elegant luncheon, just
    like this. Won't that do?"</p>

    <p>"I don't quite know about the elegance of the luncheon, but
    I'm sure our little excursion has been very pleasant. Don't you
    think so, Miss Rosewarne?" Mrs. Trelyon said.</p>

    <p>"Indeed I do," said Wenna, with her big, earnest eyes coming
    back from their trance.</p>

    <p>"And here is another thing," remarked young Trelyon.
    "There's a picture I've seen of the heir coming of
    age&mdash;he's a horrid, self-sufficient young cad, but never
    mind&mdash;and it seems to be a day of general jollification.
    Can't I give a present to somebody? Well, I'm going to give it
    to a young lady who never cares for anything but what she can
    give away again to somebody else; and it is&mdash;well, it
    is&mdash;Why don't you guess, Mabyn?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know what you mean to give Wenna," said Mabyn
    naturally.</p>

    <p>"Why, you silly! I mean to give her a dozen
    sewing-machines&mdash;a baker's dozen&mdash;thirteen. There!
    Oh, I heard you as you came along. It was all, 'Three
    sewing-machines will cost so much, and four sewing-machines
    will cost so much, and five sewing-machines will cost so much.
    And a penny a week from so many subscribers will be so much,
    and twopence a week from so many will be so much;' and all this
    as if my mother could tell you how much twice two was. My
    arithmetic ain't very brilliant, but as for hers&mdash;And
    these you shall have, Miss Wenna&mdash;one baker's dozen of
    sewing-machines, as per order, duly delivered, carriage
    free&mdash;empty casks and bottles to be returned."</p>

    <p>"That is very kind of you, Mr. Trelyon," Wenna
    said&mdash;and all the dreams had gone straight out of her head
    so soon as this was mentioned&mdash;"but we can't possibly
    accept them. You know our scheme is to make the sewing club
    quite self-supporting&mdash;no charity."</p>

    <p>"Oh, what stuff!" the young gentleman cried. "You know you
    will give all your labor and supervision for nothing: isn't
    that charity? And you know you will let off all sorts of people
    owing you subscriptions the moment some blessed baby falls ill.
    And you know you won't charge interest on all the outlay. But
    if you insist on paying me back for my sewing-machines out of
    the overwhelming profits at the end of next year, then I'll
    take the money. I'm not proud."</p>

    <p>"Then we will take six sewing-machines from you, if you
    please, Mr. Trelyon, on those conditions," said Wenna gravely.
    And Master Harry&mdash;with a look toward Mabyn which was just
    about as good as a wink&mdash;consented.</p>

    <p>As they drove quietly back again to Eglosilyan, Mabyn had
    taken her former <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span> place by the driver, and
       found him uncommonly thoughtful. He answered her questions,
       but that was all; and it was so unusual to find Harry
       Trelyon in this mood that she said to him, "Mr. Trelyon,
       have you been seeing ghosts, too?"</p>

    <p>He turned to her and said, "I was thinking about something.
    Look here, Mabyn: did you ever know any one, or do you know any
    one, whose face is a sort of barometer to you? Suppose that you
    see her look pale and tired or sad in any way, then down go
    your spirits, and you almost wish you had never been born. When
    you see her face brighten up and get full of healthy color, you
    feel glad enough to burst out singing or go mad: anyhow, you
    know that everything's all right. What the weather is, what
    people may say about you, whatever else may happen to you,
    that's nothing: all you want to see is just that one person's
    face look perfectly bright and perfectly happy, and nothing can
    touch you then. Did you ever know anybody like that?" he added
    rather abruptly.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes," said Mabyn, in a low voice: "that is when you are
    in love with some one. And there is only one face in all the
    world that I look to for all these things, there is only one
    person I know who tells you openly and simply in her face all
    that affects her, and that is our Wenna. I suppose you have
    noticed that, Mr. Trelyon?"</p>

    <p>But he did not make any answer.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>

    <h3>CONFESSION.</h3>

    <p>The lad lay dreaming in the warm meadows by the side of a
    small and rapid brook, the clear waters of which plashed and
    bubbled in the sunlight as they hurried past the brown stones.
    His fishing-rod lay beside him, hidden in the long grass and
    the daisies. The sun was hot in the valley&mdash;shining on a
    wall of gray rock behind him, and throwing purple shadows over
    the clefts; shining on the dark bushes beside the stream and on
    the lush green of the meadows; shining on the trees beyond, in
    the shadow of which some dark red cattle were standing. Then
    away on the other side of the valley rose gently-sloping woods,
    gray and green in the haze of the heat, and over these again
    was the pale blue sky with scarcely a cloud in it. It was a hot
    day to be found in spring-time, but the waters of the brook
    seemed cool and pleasant as they gurgled by, and occasionally a
    breath of wind blew over from the woods. For the rest, he lay
    so still on this fine, indolent, dreamy morning that the birds
    around seemed to take no note of his presence, and one of the
    large woodpeckers, with his scarlet head and green body
    brilliant in the sun, flew close by him and disappeared into
    the bushes opposite like a sudden gleam of color shot by a
    diamond.</p>

    <p>"Next month," he was thinking to himself as he lay with his
    hands behind his head, not caring to shade his handsome and
    well-tanned face from the warm sun&mdash;"next month I shall be
    twenty-one, and most folks will consider me a man. Anyhow, I
    don't know the man whom I wouldn't fight or run or ride or
    shoot against for any wager he liked. But of all the people who
    know anything about me, just that one whose opinion I care for
    will not consider me a man at all, but only a boy. And that
    without saying anything. You can tell, somehow, by a mere look,
    what her feelings are; and you know that what she thinks is
    true. Of course it's true&mdash;I am only a boy. What's the
    good of me to anybody? I could look after a farm&mdash;that is,
    I could look after other people doing their work&mdash;but I
    couldn't do any work myself. And that seems to me what she is
    always looking at: 'What's the good of you, what are you doing,
    what are you busy about?' It's all very well for her to be
    busy, for she can do a hundred thousand things, and she is
    always at them. What can I do?"</p>

    <p>Then his wandering day-dreamings took another turn: "It was
    an odd thing for Mabyn to say&mdash;'<i>That is when you are in
    love with some one</i>.' But those girls take everything for
    love. They don't know how you can admire, almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> to worshiping, the goodness
       of a woman, and how you are anxious that she should be well
       and happy, and how you would do anything in the world to
       please her, without fancying straight away that you are in
       love with her, and want to marry her and drive about in the
       same carriage with her. I shall be quite as fond of Wenna
       Rosewarne when she is married, although I shall hate that
       little brute with his rum and his treacle. The cheek of him,
       in asking her to marry him, is astonishing. He is the most
       hideous little beast that could have been picked out to
       marry any woman, but I suppose he has appealed to her
       compassion, and then she'll do anything. But if there was
       anybody else in love with her, if she cared the least bit
       about anybody else, wouldn't I go straight to her and insist
       on her shunting that fellow aside? What claim has he on any
       other feeling of hers but her compassion? Why, if that
       fellow were to come and try to frighten her, and if I were
       in the affair, and if she appealed to me even by a look,
       then there would be short work with something or
       somebody."</p>

    <p>He got up hastily, with something of a gloomy and angry look
    on his face. He did not notice that he had startled all the
    birds around from out of the bushes. He picked up his rod and
    line in a morose fashion, not seeming to care about adding to
    the half dozen small and red-speckled trout he had in his
    basket.</p>

    <p>While he was thus irresolutely standing he caught sight of a
    girl's figure coming rapidly along the valley under the shadow
    of some ash trees growing by the stream. It was Wenna Rosewarne
    herself, and she seemed to be hurrying toward him. She was
    carrying some black object in her arms.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Mr. Trelyon," she said, "what am I to do with this
    little dog? I saw him kicking in the road and foaming at the
    mouth; and then he got up and ran, and I caught him&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Before she had time to say anything more the young man made
    a sudden dive at the dog, caught hold of him and turned and
    heaved him into the stream. He fell into a little pool of clear
    brown water: he spluttered and paddled there for a second, then
    he got his footing and scrambled across the stones up to the
    opposite bank, where he began shaking the water from his coat
    among the long grass.</p>

    <p>"Oh, how could you be so disgracefully cruel?" she said,
    with her face full of indignation.</p>

    <p>"And how could you be so imprudent?"' he said quite as
    vehemently. "Why, whose is the dog?"</p>

    <p>"I don't know."</p>

    <p>"And you catch up some mongrel little cur in the middle of
    the highway&mdash;He might have been mad."</p>

    <p>"I knew he wasn't mad," she said: "it was only a fit; and
    how could you be so cruel as to throw him into the river?"</p>

    <p>"Oh," said the young man, coolly, "a clash of cold water is
    the best thing for a dog that has a fit. Besides, I don't care
    what he had or what I did with him, so long as you are safe.
    Your little finger is of more consequence than the necks of all
    the curs in the country."</p>

    <p>"Oh, it is mean of you to say that," she retorted warmly.
    "You have no pity for those wretched little things that are at
    every one's mercy. If it were a handsome and beautiful dog,
    now, you would care for that, or if it were a dog that was
    skilled in getting game for you, you would care for that."</p>

    <p>"Yes, certainly," he said: "these are dogs that have
    something to recommend them."</p>

    <p>"Yes, and every one is good to them: they are not in need of
    your favor. But you don't think of the wretched little brutes
    that have nothing to recommend them, that only live on
    sufferance, that every one kicks and despises and starves."</p>

    <p>"Well," said he with some compunction, "look there! That new
    friend of yours&mdash;he's no great beauty, you must
    confess&mdash;is all right now. The bath has cured him. As soon
    as he's done licking his paws he'll be off home, wherever that
    may be. But I've always noticed that about you, Wenna: you're
    always on the side of things that are ugly and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> helpless and useless in the
       world; and you're not very just to those who don't agree
       with you. For after all, you know, one wants time to acquire
       that notion of yours&mdash;that it is only weak and
       ill-favored creatures that are worthy of the least
       consideration."</p>

    <p>"Yes," she said rather sadly, "you want time to learn
    that."</p>

    <p>He looked at her. Did she mean that her sympathy with those
    who were weak and ill-favored arose from some strange
    consciousness that she herself was both? His cheeks began to
    burn red. He had often heard her hint something like that, and
    yet he had never dared to reason with her or show her what he
    thought of her. Should he do so now?</p>

    <p>"Wenna," he said, blushing hotly, "I can't make you out
    sometimes. You speak as if no one cared for you. Now, if I were
    to tell you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, I am not so ungrateful," she said hastily. "I know that
    two or three do; and&mdash;and, Mr. Trelyon, do you think you
    could coax that little dog over the stream again? You see he
    has come back again&mdash;he can't find his way home."</p>

    <p>Mr. Trelyon called to the dog: it came down to the river's
    side, and whined and shivered on the brink.</p>

    <p>"Do you care a brass farthing about the little beast?" he
    said to Wenna.</p>

    <p>"I must put him on his way home," she answered.</p>

    <p>Thereupon the young man went straight through the stream to
    the other side, jumping the deeper portions of the channel: he
    caught up the dog and brought it back to her; and when she was
    very angry with him for this mad performance, he merely kicked
    some of the water out of his trousers and laughed.</p>

    <p>Then a smile broke over her face also. "Is that an example
    of what people would do for me?" she said shyly. "Mr. Trelyon,
    you must keep walking through the warm grass till your feet are
    dry; or will you come along to the inn, and I shall get you
    some shoes and stockings? Pray do, and at once. I am rather in
    a hurry."</p>

    <p>"I'll go along with you, anyway," he said, "and put this
    little brute into the highway. But why are you in a hurry?"</p>

    <p>"Because," said Wenna, as they set out to walk down the
    valley&mdash;"because my mother and I are going to Penzance the
    day after to-morrow, and I have a lot of things to get
    ready."</p>

    <p>"To Penzance?" said he with a sudden falling of the
    face.</p>

    <p>"Yes. She has been dreadfully out of sorts lately, and she
    has sunk into a kind of despondent state. The doctor says she
    must have a change&mdash;a holiday, really&mdash;to take her
    away from the cares of the house&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Why, Wenna, it's you who want the holiday&mdash;it's you
    who have the cares of the house," Trelyon said warmly.</p>

    <p>"And so I have persuaded her to go to Penzance for a week or
    two, and I go with her to look after her. Mr. Trelyon, would
    you be kind enough to keep Rock for me until we come back? I am
    afraid of the servants neglecting him."</p>

    <p>"You needn't be afraid of that: he's not one of the
    ill-favored&mdash;every one will attend to him," said Trelyon;
    and then he added, after a minute or two of silence, "The fact
    is, I think I shall be at Penzance also while you are there. My
    cousin Juliott is coming here in about a fortnight to celebrate
    the important event of my coming of age, and I promised to go
    for her. I might as well go now."</p>

    <p>She said nothing.</p>

    <p>"I might as well go any time," he said rather impatiently.
    "I haven't got anything to do. Do you know, before you came
    along just now, I was thinking what a very useful person you
    were in the world, and what a very useless person I
    was&mdash;about as useless as this little cur. I think somebody
    should take me up and heave me into a river. And I was
    wondering, too"&mdash;here he became a little more embarrassed
    and slow of speech&mdash;"I was wondering what you would say
    if I spoke to you, and gave you a hint that
    sometimes&mdash;that sometimes one might wish to cut this lazy
    life if one only knew how, and whether so very busy a person as
    yourself mightn't&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;give one some
    notion&mdash;some sort of hint, in fact&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, but then, Mr. Trelyon," she said quite cheerfully, "you
    would think it very <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> strange if I asked you to
       take any interest in the things that keep me busy. That is
       not a man's work. I wouldn't accept you as a pupil."</p>

    <p>He burst out laughing. "Why," said he, "do you think I
    offered to mend stockings and set sums on slates and coddle
    babies?"</p>

    <p>"As for setting sums on slates," she remarked with a quiet
    impertinence, "the working of them out might be of use to
    you."</p>

    <p>"Yes, and a serious trouble too," he said candidly. "No,
    no&mdash;that cottage business ain't in my line. I like to have
    a joke with the old folks or a romp with the kids, but I can't
    go in for cutting out pinafores. I shall leave my mother to do
    my share of that for me; and hasn't she come out strong lately,
    eh? It's quite a new amusement for her, and it's driven a deal
    of that organ-grinding and stuff out of her head; and I've a
    notion some o' those parsons&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He stopped short, remembering who his companion was; and at
    this moment they came to a gate which opened out on the
    highway, through which the small cur was passed to find his way
    home.</p>

    <p>"Now, Miss Wenna," said the young man&mdash;"By the way, you
    see how I remember to address you respectfully ever since you
    got sulky with me about it the other day?"</p>

    <p>"I am sure I did not get sulky with you, and especially
    about that," she remarked with much composure. "I suppose you
    are not aware that you have dropped the 'Miss' several times
    this morning already?"</p>

    <p>"Did I, really? Well, then, I'm awfully sorry; but then you
    are so good-natured you tempt one to forget; and my mother she
    always calls you Wenna Rosewarne now in speaking to me, as if
    you were a little school-girl, instead of being the chief
    support and pillar of all the public affairs of Eglosilyan. And
    now, Miss Wenna, I sha'n't go down the road with you, because
    my damp boots and garments would gather the dust; but perhaps
    you wouldn't mind stopping two seconds here, and I'm going to
    go a cracker and ask you a question: What should a fellow in my
    position try to do? You see, I haven't had the least training
    for any one of the professions, even if I had any sort of
    capacity&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"But why should you wish to have a profession?" she said
    simply. "You have more money than is good for you already."</p>

    <p>"Then you don't think it ignominious," he said, with his
    face lighting up considerably, "to fish in summer and shoot in
    autumn and hunt in winter, and make that the only business of
    one's life?"</p>

    <p>"I should if it were the only business, but it needn't be,
    and you don't make it so. My father speaks very highly of the
    way you look after your property; and he knows what attending
    to an estate is. And then you have so many opportunities of
    being kind and useful to the people about you that you might do
    more good that way than by working night and day at a
    profession. Then you owe much to yourself, because if every one
    began with himself, and educated himself, and became satisfied
    and happy with doing his best, there would be no bad conduct
    and wretchedness to call for interference. I don't see why you
    should be ashamed of shooting and hunting and all that, and
    doing them as well as anybody else, or far better, as I hear
    people say. I don't think a man is bound to have ambition and
    try to become famous: you might be of much greater use in the
    world, even in such a little place as Eglosilyan, than if you
    were in Parliament. I did say to Mrs. Trelyon that I should
    like to see you in Parliament, because one has a natural pride
    in any person one admires and likes very much, and one
    wishes&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He saw the quick look of fear that sprang to her
    eyes&mdash;not a sudden appearance of shy embarrassment, but of
    absolute fear&mdash;and he was almost as startled by her
    blunder as she herself was. He hastily came to her rescue. He
    thanked her in a few rapid and formal words for her patience
    and advice; and, as he saw she was trying to turn away and hide
    the mortification visible on her face, he shook hands with her
    and let her go.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>

    <p>Then he turned. He had been startled, it is true, and
    grieved to see the pain her chance words had caused her. But
    now a great glow of delight rose up within him, and he could
    have called aloud to the blue skies and the silent woods
    because of the joy that filled his heart. They were but chance
    words, of course. They were uttered with no deliberate
    intention: on the contrary, her quick look of pain showed how
    bitterly she regretted the blunder. Moreover, he congratulated
    himself on his rapid piece of acting, and assured himself that
    she would believe that he had not noticed that admission of
    hers. They were idle words: she would forget them. The
    incident, so far as she was concerned, was gone.</p>

    <p>But not so far as he was concerned. For now he knew that the
    person whom, above all other persons in the world, he was most
    desirous to please, whose respect and esteem he was most
    anxious to obtain, had not only condoned much of his idleness
    out of the abundant charity of her heart, but had further, and
    by chance, revealed to him that she gave him some little share
    of that affection which she seemed to shed generously and
    indiscriminately on so many folks and things around her. He,
    too, was now in the charmed circle. He walked with a new pride
    through the warm, green meadows, his rod over his shoulder: he
    whistled as he went, or he sang snatches of "The Rose of
    Allandale." He met two small boys out bird's-nesting: he gave
    them a shilling apiece, and then inconsistently informed them
    that if he caught them then or at any other time with a bird's
    nest in their hands he would cuff their ears. Then he walked
    hastily home, put by his fishing-rod, and shut himself up in
    his study with half a dozen of those learned volumes which he
    had brought back unsoiled from school.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>

    <h3>ON WINGS OF HOPE.</h3>

    <p>When Trelyon arrived late one evening at Penzance he was
    surprised to find his uncle's coachman awaiting him at the
    station: "What's the matter, Tobias? Is the old gentleman going
    to die? You don't mean to say you are here for me?"</p>

    <p>"Ya&auml;s, zor, I be," said the little old man with no
    great courtesy.</p>

    <p>"Then he is going to die if he sends out his horse at this
    time o' night. Look here, Tobias: I'll put my portmanteau
    inside and come on the box to have a talk with you&mdash;you're
    such a jolly old card, you know&mdash;and you'll tell me all
    that's happened since I last enjoyed my uncle's bountiful
    hospitality."</p>

    <p>This the young man did: and then the brown-faced, wiry and
    surly little person, having started his horse, proceeded to
    tell his story in a series of grumbling and disconnected
    sentences. He was not nearly so taciturn as he looked: "The
    ma&auml;ster he went s&uuml;n to bed to-night: 'twere Miss
    Juliott sent me to the station, without tellin' en. He's
    gettin' worse and worse, that's sure: if y&uuml; be for giving
    me half a crown, like, or any one that comes to the house, he
    finds it out and stops it out o' my wages: yes, he does, zor,
    the old fule!"</p>

    <p>"Tobias, be a little more respectful to my uncle, if you
    please."</p>

    <p>"Why, zor, y&uuml; knaw en well enough," said the man in the
    same surly fashion. "And I'll tell y&uuml; this, Ma&auml;ster
    Harry, if y&uuml; be after dinner with en, and he has a bottle
    o' poort wine that he puts on the mantelpiece, and he says to
    y&uuml; to let that alo&auml;n, vor 'tis a medicine-zart o'
    wine, don't y&uuml; heed en, but have that wine. 'Tis the real
    old poort wine, zor, that y&uuml;r vather gied en&mdash;the
    dahmned old pagan!"</p>

    <p>The young man burst out laughing, instead of reprimanding
    Tobias, who maintained his sulky impassiveness of face.</p>

    <p>"Why, zor, I be gardener now, too: ya&auml;s I be, to save
    the wages. And he's gone clean mazed about that
    garden&mdash;ya&auml;s, I think. Would y&uuml; believe this,
    Ma&auml;ster Harry, that he killed every one o' the blessed
    strawberries last year with a lot o' wrack from the bache,
    because he said it w&uuml;d be as good for them as for the
    'sparagus?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>

    <p>"Well, but the old chap finds amusement in pottering about
    the garden&mdash;" said Master Harry.</p>

    <p>"The old fule!" repeated Tobias, in an under tone.</p>

    <p>"And the theory is sound about the seaweed and the
    strawberries; just as his old notion of getting a green rose by
    pouring sulphate of copper in at the roots."</p>

    <p>"Ya&auml;s, that were another pretty thing, Ma&auml;ster
    Harry, and he had the tin labels all printed out in French, and
    he waited and waited, and there bain't a fairly g&uuml;de rose
    left in the garden. And his violet glass for the cucumbers: he
    burned en up to once, although 'twere fine to hear'n talk about
    the sunlight and the rays and such nonsenses. He be a strange
    mahn, zor, and a dahmned close'n with his penny-pieces,
    Christian and all as he calls his-sen. There's Miss Juliott,
    zor, she's go-in' to get married, I suppose; and when she goes
    no one 'll dare spake to 'n. Be y&uuml; going to stop long this
    time, Ma&auml;ster Harry?"</p>

    <p>"Not at the Hollies, Tobias. I shall go down to the Queen's
    to-morrow: I've got rooms there."</p>

    <p>"So much the better&mdash;so much the better," said the
    frank but inhospitable retainer; and presently the jogtrot old
    animal between the shafts was pulled up in front of a certain
    square old-fashioned building of gray stone which was prettily
    surrounded with trees. They had arrived at the Rev. Mr.
    Penaluna's house, and there was a young lady standing in the
    light of the hall, she having opened the door very softly as
    she heard the carriage drive up.</p>

    <p>"So here you are, Harry; and you'll stay with us the whole
    fortnight, won't you? Come in to the dining-room&mdash;I have
    some supper ready for you. Papa's gone to bed, and he desired
    me to give you his excuses, and he hopes you'll make yourself
    quite at home, as you always do, Harry."</p>

    <p>He did make himself quite at home, for, having kissed his
    cousin and flung his topcoat down in the hall, he went into the
    dining-room and took possession of an easy-chair.</p>

    <p>"Sha'n't have any supper, Jue, thank you. You won't mind my
    lighting a cigar&mdash;somebody's been smoking here already.
    And what's the least poisonous claret you've got?"</p>

    <p>"Well, I declare!" she said, but she got him the wine all
    the same, and watched him light his cigar: then she took the
    easy-chair opposite.</p>

    <p>"Tell us about your young man, Jue," he said. "Girls always
    like to talk about that."</p>

    <p>"Do they?" she said. "Not to boys."</p>

    <p>"I shall be twenty-one in a fortnight. I am thinking of
    getting married."</p>

    <p>"So I hear," she remarked quietly.</p>

    <p>Now he had been talking nonsense at random, mostly intent on
    getting his cigar well lit, but this little observation rather
    startled him. "What have you heard?" he said abruptly.</p>

    <p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;the ordinary stupid gossip," she said,
    though she was watching him rather closely. "Are you going to
    stay with us for the next fortnight?"</p>

    <p>"No, I have got rooms at the Queen's."</p>

    <p>"I thought so. One might have expected you, however, to stay
    with your relations when you came to Penzance."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that's all gammon, Jue," he said: "you know very well
    your father doesn't care to have any one stay with
    you&mdash;it's too much bother. You'll have quite enough of me
    while I am in Penzance."</p>

    <p>"Shall we have anything of you?" she said with apparent
    indifference. "I understood that Miss Rosewarne and her mamma
    had already come here."</p>

    <p>"And what if they have?" he said with unnecessary
    fierceness.</p>

    <p>"Well, Harry," she said, "you needn't get unto a temper
    about it, but people will talk, you know; and they say that
    your attentions to that young lady are rather marked,
    considering that she is engaged to be married; and you have
    induced your mother to make a pet of her. Shall I go on?"</p>

    <p>"No, you needn't," he said with a strong effort to overcome
    his anger. "You're quite right&mdash;people do talk, but they
    wouldn't talk so much if other people didn't carry tales. Why,
    it isn't like you, Jue! I thought you were another
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> sort. And about this girl,
       of all girls in the world!"</p>

    <p>He got up and began walking about the room, and talking with
    considerable vehemence, but no more in anger. He would tell her
    what cause there was for this silly gossip. He would tell her
    who this girl was who had been lightly mentioned. And in his
    blunt, frank, matter-of-fact way, which did not quite conceal
    his emotion, he revealed to his cousin all that he thought of
    Wenna Rosewarne, and what he hoped for her in the future, and
    what their present relations were, and then plainly asked her
    if she could condemn him.</p>

    <p>Miss Juliott was touched: "Sit down, Harry: I have wanted to
    talk to you, and I don't mean to heed any gossip. Sit down,
    please&mdash;you frighten me by walking up and down like that.
    Now, I'm going to talk common sense to you, for I should like
    to be your friend; and your mother is so easily led away by any
    sort of sentiment that she isn't likely to have seen with my
    eyes. Suppose that this Miss Rosewarne&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, hold hard a bit, Jue," he said imperatively. "You may
    talk till the millennium, but just keep off her, I warn
    you."</p>

    <p>"Will you hear me out, you silly boy? Suppose that Miss
    Rosewarne is everything that you believe her to be. I'm going
    to grant that, because I'm going to ask you a question. You
    can't have such an opinion of any girl, and be constantly in
    her society, and go following her about like this, without
    falling in love with her. Now, in that case would you propose
    to marry her?"</p>

    <p>"I marry her!" he said, his face becoming suddenly pale for
    a moment. "Jue, you are mad! I am not fit to marry a girl like
    that. You don't know her. Why&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Let all that alone, Harry: when a man is in love with a
    woman he always thinks he's good enough for her; and whether he
    does or not he tries to get her for a wife. Don't let us
    discuss your comparative merits: one might even put in a word
    for you. But suppose you drifted into being in love with
    her&mdash;and I consider that quite probable&mdash;and suppose
    you forgot, as I know you would forget, the difference in your
    social position, how would you like to go and ask her to break
    her promise to the gentleman to whom she is engaged?"</p>

    <p>Master Harry laughed aloud in a somewhat nervous fashion:
    "Him? Look here, Jue: leave me out of it&mdash;I haven't the
    cheek to talk of myself in that connection&mdash;but if there
    was a decent sort of fellow whom that girl really took a liking
    to, do you think he would let that elderly and elegant swell
    out in Jamaica stand in his way? He would be no such fool, I
    can tell you. He would consider the girl first of all. He would
    say to himself, 'I mean to make this girl happy; if any one
    interferes, let him look out!' Why, Jue, you don't suppose any
    man would be frightened by that sort of thing?"</p>

    <p>Miss Juliott did not seem quite convinced by this burst of
    scornful oratory. She continued quietly, "You forget something,
    Harry. Your heroic young man might find it easy to do something
    wild&mdash;to fight with that gentleman in the West Indies, or
    murder him, or anything like that, just as you see in a
    story&mdash;but perhaps Miss Rosewarne might have something to
    say."</p>

    <p>"I meant if she cared for him," Trelyon said, looking
    down.</p>

    <p>"Granting that also, do you think it likely your hot-headed
    gentleman would be able to get a young lady to disgrace herself
    by breaking her plighted word and deceiving a man who went away
    trusting in her? You say she has a very tender
    conscience&mdash;that she is so anxious to consult every one's
    happiness before her own, and all that. Probably it is true. I
    say nothing against her. But to bring the matter back to
    yourself&mdash;for I believe you're hot-headed enough to do
    anything&mdash;what would you think of her if you or anybody
    else persuaded her to do such a treacherous thing?"</p>

    <p>"She is not capable of treachery," he said somewhat stiffly.
    "If you've got no more cheerful things to talk about, you'd
    better go to bed, Jue. I shall finish my cigar by
    myself."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>

    <p>"Very well, then, Harry. You know your room. Will you put
    out the lamp when you have lit your candle?"</p>

    <p>So she went, and the young man was left alone in no very
    enviable frame of mind. He sat and smoked while the clock on
    the mantelpiece swung its gilded boy and struck the hours and
    half hours with unheeded regularity. He lit a second cigar, and
    a third; he forgot the wine. It seemed to him that he was
    looking on all the roads of life that lay before him, and they
    were lit up by as strange and new a light as that which was
    beginning to shine over the world outside. New fancies seemed
    to awake with the new dawn. For himself to ask Wenna Rosewarne
    to be his wife! Could he but win the tender and shy regard of
    her eyes he would fall at her feet and bathe them with his
    tears. And if this wonderful thing were possible&mdash;if she
    could put her hand in his and trust to him for safety in all
    the coming years they might live together&mdash;what man of
    woman born would dare to interfere? There was a blue light
    coming in through the shutters. He went to the window: the
    topmost leaves of the trees were quivering in the cold air far
    up there in the clearing skies, where the stars were fading out
    one by one, and he could hear the sound of the sea on the
    distant beach, and he knew that across the gray plain of waters
    the dawn was breaking, and that over the sleeping world another
    day was rising that seemed to him the first day of a new and
    tremulous life, full of joy and courage and hope.</p>

    <p>[TO BE CONTINUED.]</p>

    <h2>ON THE VIA SAN BASILIO.</h2>

    <p>In Rome, 1851; a cold, dreary day in December&mdash;one of
    those days in which a man's ambition seems to desert him
    entirely, leaving only its grinning skeleton to mock him.
    Depressing as was the weather to a man who had cheerfulness as
    a companion by which to repel its blustering attacks, and raise
    his mind above the despondency it was calculated to produce,
    how much more so to one whose hope had gone out as a flickering
    lamp in a sudden gust of wind, and the sharp steel of whose
    ambition had turned to pierce his own heart!</p>

    <p>Such a man, on the day mentioned, was walking along the Via
    San Basilio. He was small in stature, poorly clad, and so thin,
    and even cadaverous, that the casual observer might have been
    under apprehension lest a gust of wind a little stronger than
    the average might blow him entirely away; yet his air and
    manner were proud and haughty, and what little evidences of
    feeling peered through the signs of dissipation too apparent on
    his naturally attractive face were those of genuine refinement.
    He was accompanied by a cicerone, or servant, as
    villainous-looking a fellow as one often meets, even in Italy,
    where an evil expression is so often seen stamped on handsome
    features.</p>

    <p>Along the Via San Basilio the two men walked until they
    stood opposite the door of No. 51. Sacred ground this, and
    historical as well. Art had her votaries here, as the tourist
    of to-day will find she still has, at whose shrines pilgrims
    from afar and from near worshiped, and grew better and stronger
    for their ministrations. Crawford, then at the acme of his
    fame, had his constantly-thronged studio in the immediate
    vicinity, while those at No. 51 embraced, among others, that of
    Tenerani, the famous Italian sculptor, whose work is always in
    such fine dramatic taste, although he never sacrifices his love
    and deep feeling of reverence for Nature, combining that with
    the most delightful charms of Greek art. Among this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> artist's most noted works
       will be remembered his "Descent from the Cross," which
       tourists visiting the Torlonia chapel in the Lateran never
       gaze upon without a thrill. The house was owned and also
       occupied by Bienaim&eacute;, a French sculptor who afterward
       became famous.</p>

    <p>In the immediate vicinity stands the famous Palazzo
    Barberini, begun by Urban VIII. (Maffeo Barberini), who sat in
    the pontifical chair from 1623 to 1644, and finished by Bernini
    in 1640. This palace contains many paintings of historical
    interest by Raphael, Titian, Guido, Claude and others. The one
    by the first-mentioned artist is a Fornarina, and bears the
    autograph of the painter on the armlet. But the picture that
    attracts the most attention here is one of world-wide
    reputation, copies, engravings and photographs of which are
    everywhere to be met with&mdash;Guido's Beatrice Cenci. A great
    divergence of opinion, as is well known, exists in regard to
    the portrait. It bears the pillar and crown of the Colonnas, to
    which family it probably belonged. According to the family
    tradition, it was taken on the night before her execution.
    Other accounts state that it was painted by Guido from memory
    after he had seen her on the scaffold. Judging from the
    position in which the poor girl's head is represented, one
    would more readily give credence to the latter story, and think
    the artist's memory had preserved her look and position as she
    turned her head for a last look at the brutal, bellowing crowd
    behind.</p>

    <p>In the piazza of the palace is a very beautiful fountain,
    utilized by one of the oldest Roman statues, representing a
    faun blowing water from a conch-shell.</p>

    <p>But we must return to the Via San Basilio, and the two
    wayfarers we left standing in front of No. 51. After gazing a
    moment at the number to assure themselves that they were right,
    they entered, and knocked at the first door, which was opened
    by the occupant of the apartment. He was an artist and a man of
    very marked characteristics. Seven years later Hawthorne wrote
    as follows of him: "He is a plain, homely Yankee, quite
    unpolished by his many years' residence in Italy. He talks
    ungrammatically; walks with a strange, awkward gait and
    stooping shoulders; is altogether unpicturesque, but wins one's
    confidence by his very lack of grace. It is not often that we
    see an artist so entirely free from affectation in his aspect
    and deportment. His pictures were views of Swiss and Italian
    scenery, and were most beautiful and true. One of them, a
    moonlight picture, was really magical&mdash;the moon shining so
    brightly that it seemed to throw a light even beyond the limits
    of the picture; and yet his sunrises and sunsets, and noontides
    too, were nowise inferior to this, although their excellence
    required somewhat longer study to be fully appreciated."</p>

    <p>After this introduction by our sweet and quaint romancer,
    the reader will hardly need be told that the two strangers
    stood in the presence of America's now illustrious artist,
    George L. Brown. But one seeing him then, as he stood almost
    scowling at the two strangers, would hardly have idealized him
    into the artist whose pencil has done so much of late years to
    give American art a distinctive name through his poetical
    delineations of the rare, sun-tinted atmosphere that hovers
    over Italian landscapes. However, our apology for him must be
    that the day was raw and blustering, and that he had no sooner
    caught sight of the men through his window, as they
    hesitatingly entered the door, than his suspicions were
    aroused.</p>

    <p>The Italian acted as spokesman, and inquired if there were
    any rooms to let in the building. Brown, thinking this the
    easiest way of ridding himself of the visitors, went in search
    of the landlord, who came, and after a moment's conversation
    the whole party entered the studio, much to its owner's
    displeasure.</p>

    <p>The cicerone did most of the talking, though now and then
    the other made a remark or two in broken Italian. But this was
    only for the first few moments. He soon became oblivious of all
    save art, of which one could see at a glance he was
    passionately fond. One of Mr. Brown's pictures&mdash;a large
    one he was then engaged on&mdash;particularly attracted
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> his attention. He drew
       closer and closer to the canvas, examining it with a
       minuteness that showed the connoisseur, and finally
       remarked: "It is very fine in color, sir, and the atmosphere
       is delicious. Why have I not heard of you before?" examining
       the corner of the canvas for the artist's name, but speaking
       in a tone and with an air that gave Brown the impression he
       was indulging in the random flattery so current in studios.
       So, ignoring the question, he asked with a slight shrug of
       the shoulders, "Are you an artist?"</p>

    <p>"I paint a little," was the reply, with an air of modesty
    which Brown mistook for the bashful half-assertion of some
    daubing amateur.</p>

    <p>Just then the cicerone came forward and announced that the
    bargain was completed and the room ready for occupancy.</p>

    <p>"I shall be happy&mdash;no, <i>happy</i> is not a good word
    for me&mdash;I shall be glad to see you in my studio when I
    have moved in, and perhaps you may see some things to please
    you."</p>

    <p>So saying, the stranger departed, leaving Brown not a whit
    better impressed with him than at first.</p>

    <p>The next morning the two called again, when the gentleman
    made an examination of the room selected the day before, having
    met Mr. Brown in the hall-way and invited him in. On entering,
    the new occupant took from his pocket a piece of chalk and a
    compass and made a number of circles and figures on the floor
    to determine when the sun would shine in the room. Brown
    watched him with a certain degree of curiosity and amusement,
    and finally, concluding he was half crazy, returned to his own
    studio.</p>

    <p>The next day the cicerone called alone to see about some
    repairs, when Brown hailed him: "<i>Buono giorno. Che &egrave;
    questo</i>?" ("Good-day. Who is that?")</p>

    <p>"<i>Non sapete</i>?" ("Don't you know?"), was the Italian's
    response. "Why, that is the celebrated Brullof."</p>

    <p>Brown started as though shot. First there flashed through
    his brain the remembrance of how cavalierly he had treated the
    distinguished artist, and then a quick panorama of his recent
    history, which had been the gossip of studios and art-circles
    for some time back. "I must go to him," he said, "and apologize
    for not treating him with more deference."</p>

    <p>"<i>Non, signore</i>," was the cicerone's response. "Never
    mind: let it rest. He is a man of the world, and pays little
    heed to such things. Besides, he is so overwhelmed with his
    private griefs that he has probably noticed no slight."</p>

    <p>However, when the great Russian artist took possession of
    his studio his American brother of the pencil made his apology,
    and received this response; "Don't waste words on so trivial a
    matter. Do I not court the contempt of a world that I despise
    to my heart's core? Say no more about it. Run in and see me
    when agreeable; and if you have no better callers than such a
    plaything of fate as I, maybe you will not refuse me occasional
    admittance."</p>

    <p>The Russian artist now shunned notoriety as he had formerly
    courted it. Little is known of his history beyond mere rumor,
    and that only in artistic circles. He was born at St.
    Petersburg in 1799 or 1800, and gave himself to the study of
    art at an early age, becoming an especial proficient in color
    and composition. One of his most widely-known works is "The
    Last Days of Pompeii," which created great enthusiasm a quarter
    of a century ago. This, however, was painted during his career
    of dissipation, and its vivid coloring seemed to have been
    drawn from a soul morbid with secret woes and craving a
    nepenthe which never came.</p>

    <p>The young artist was petted and idolized by the wealth and
    nobility of St. Petersburg, where he married a beautiful woman,
    and became court-painter to the czar Nicholas about the year
    1830. For some years no couple lived more happily, and no
    artist swayed a greater multitude of fashion and wealth than
    he; but scandal began to whisper that the czar was as fond of
    the handsome, brilliant wife of the young court-painter as the
    cultivated people of St. Petersburg were of the husband's
    marvelously colored works; and when at last the fact became
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> known to Brullof that the
       monarch who had honored him through an intelligent
       appreciation of art had dishonored him through a guilty
       passion for his wife, he left St. Petersburg, swore never
       again to set foot on Russian soil or be recognized as a
       Russian subject, and, plunging headlong into a wild career
       of dissipation, was thenceforth a wanderer up and down the
       continent of Europe.</p>

    <p>It was when this career had borne its inevitable fruit, and
    he was but a mere wreck of the polished gentleman of a few
    years previous, that Brullof came to the Via San Basilio,
    where, as soon as the fact became known, visitors began to
    call. Among the first were the Russian ambassador and suite,
    who were driven up in a splendid carriage, with liveried
    attendants; but after the burly Italian had announced to his
    master who was in waiting, the door was closed, and with no
    message in return the representatives of the mightiest empire
    on the globe were left to withdraw with the best grace they
    could muster for the occasion. Similar scenes were repeated
    often during the entire Roman season. He saw but few of his
    callers&mdash;Russians, never.</p>

    <p>The Russian and the American artists became quite intimate
    during the few months they were thrown together, and Mr. Brown
    has acknowledged that he owes much of the success of his later
    efforts to hints received from the self-exiled, dying
    Russian.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Brown," he said on one occasion, while examining the
    picture on the artist's easel, "no one since Claude has painted
    atmosphere as you do. But you must follow Calam&eacute;'s
    example, and make drawing more of a study. Draw from Nature,
    and do it faithfully, and with your atmosphere I will back you
    against the world. That is bad," pointing to the huge limb of a
    tree in the foreground: "it bulges both ways, you see. Now,
    Nature is never so. Look at my arm," speaking with increased
    animation, and suddenly throwing off his coat and rolling up
    his shirt-sleeve. "When you see a convexity, you will see
    concavity opposite. Just so in Nature, especially in the trunks
    and limbs of trees."</p>

    <p>This criticism made such an impression on Brown that it
    decided him to go into more laborious work, and was the
    foundation of his habit of getting up at daybreak and going out
    to sketch rocks, trees and cattle, until he stands where he now
    does as a draughtsman.</p>

    <p>The painting which Brullof had first admired, and which had
    induced him to compare Brown to Claude in atmospheric effects,
    was a view of the Pontine Marshes, painted for Crawford the
    sculptor, and now in possession, of his widow, Mrs. Terry, at
    Rome.</p>

    <p>During this entire season the penuriousness exhibited by
    Brullof is one of the hardest phases of his character to
    explain. Though he was worth at least half a million of
    dollars, his meals were generally of the scantiest kind,
    purchased by the Italian cicerone, and cooked and eaten in his
    room. Yet a kindness would touch the hidden springs of his
    generosity as the staff of Moses did the rock of Horeb.</p>

    <p>Toward the close of the Roman season, Brullof, growing more
    and more moody, and becoming still more of a recluse, painted
    his last picture, which showed how diseased and morbid his mind
    had become. He called it "The End of All Things," and made it
    sensational to the verge of that flexible characteristic. It
    represented popes and emperors tumbling headlong into a
    terrible abyss, while the world's benefactors were ascending in
    a sort of theatrical transformation-scene. A representation of
    Christ holding a cross aloft was given, and winged angels were
    hovering here and there, much in the same manner as
    <i>coryph&eacute;es</i> and lesser auxiliaries of the ballet. A
    capital portrait of George Washington was painted in the mass
    of rubbish, perhaps as a compliment to Brown. In
    contradistinction to the portrait of Washington were seen
    prominently those of the czar Nicholas and the emperor
    Napoleon; the former put in on account of the artist's own
    private wrong, and the latter because at that time, just after
    the <i>coup d'&egrave;tat</i>, he was the execration of the
    liberty-loving world.</p>

    <p>In the spring the Russian artist gave up
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> his studio, and went down
       to some baths possessing a local reputation situated on the
       road to Florence, where he died very suddenly. Much mystery
       overhangs his last days, and absolutely no knowledge exists
       as to what became of his vast property. His cicerone robbed
       him of his gold watch and all his personal effects and
       disappeared. His remains lie buried in the Protestant
       burying-ground outside the walls of Rome, near the Porto di
       Sebastiano. His tomb is near that of Shelley and Keats, and
       the monument erected to his memory is very simple, his head
       being sculptured upon it in <i>alto relievo</i>, and on the
       opposite side an artist's palette and brushes.</p>

    <h2>THE PARSEES.</h2>

    <p>Hanging in my study is a noteworthy portrait, generally the
    first object observed by those who enter. It is an exquisite
    painting on glass, the work of L&agrave;ng Qu&agrave;, the best
    artist China has produced in our day, and it delineates the
    form and features of a singularly handsome young man. But it is
    the quaint Parsee garb that first attracts attention; and the
    weird romance that attaches to the history of the
    Fire-worshipers gives this work of art its real value, rather
    than its lines of beauty or the celebrity of the painter's
    name. This delicately-featured portrait <i>may</i> depict the
    countenance of Musaljee Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, the first-born son
    and heir of the late Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, baronet, of
    Bombay, India. That he really sat for this portrait I cannot,
    however, positively assert, since I obtained the painting from
    an English officer, who bought it of the artist, but had
    "forgotten the strange, outlandish name of the Indian nabob,"
    as he said. It is certainly the portrait of a
    <i>Parsee</i>&mdash;true to the life in features and garb, and
    it bears a striking resemblance to the young Musaljee when
    about eighteen years of age. He was not then a personage of any
    great celebrity, though the worthy son of a most remarkable
    sire, the latter long known and honored in Europe for his
    liberal and enlightened charities, and especially for his
    munificent donations, that saved the lives of thousands of
    British subjects, during the terrible famines that occurred in
    India between the years 1840 and 1846. It was in grateful
    recognition of this noble philanthropy that Queen Victoria
    conferred upon him the honor of a baronetcy, sending out a
    nobleman to act as her proxy in the presentation of a sword
    which had been handled by more than one British monarch. Sir
    Jamsetjee was the first East Indian who ever received a title
    from a European sovereign. During the terrible famines alluded
    to he not only distributed daily from his own palace a
    plentiful supply of food to all who came, but he made also
    large donations of provisions to the English governor of Bombay
    for the supply of his starving troops. When, subsequently,
    pestilence followed in the footsteps of famine, this
    true-hearted philanthropist, overstepping all prejudices of
    creed and clan, built and endowed at his own expense a free
    hospital for the sick of all nations and religions. Temporary
    bamboo cottages at first received the sick till there was time
    for the erection of the present elegant structure, which is
    built in the Gothic style, and is capable of accommodating some
    six or eight hundred patients, besides nurses and attendants.
    The physicians have been from the beginning of the enterprise
    all English, as are many of the nurses, and the supplies in
    every department are the very best the country can furnish.
    Since the death of the noble founder, the son, who inherits his
    name and title, has continued to foster with loving devotion
    the institution which stands as a lasting monument of the fame
    and virtues of his illustrious sire. The conception of such a
    charity tells not only of a generous heart, but of far-reaching
    intelligence, while the energy and perseverance of both father
    and son in carrying on, year after year, so vast a system of
    benefactions, challenge our warmest admiration.</p>

    <p>The name of the late Sir Jamsetjee stood for more than a
    score of years at the very head of the list of merchant-princes
    and ship-owners in Bombay, where he was born, and where his
    ancestors for many generations resided. He came of an old and
    wealthy family, who trace their genealogy back to the Parsee
    exodus of the eighth century; and it is said that the "sacred
    fire" has never once during all that time burned out upon their
    altar. Sir Jamsetjee himself, though probably faithful in the
    observance of the actual requirements of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> creed, was assuredly less
       strict than the majority, and being a man of large
       intellect, cultivated mind and great independence of
       character, he did not hesitate to borrow from other nations
       any customs, institutions or inventions that might tend to
       the improvement of his own people. His stately mansion was
       built and furnished in European style; his children, even
       his daughters, were carefully educated in foreign as well as
       native lore; and his own associations were with refined and
       cultivated people, without any regard to their nation or
       creed. It was while visiting at his house, in familiar
       intercourse with his family, and with other Parsees of
       similar position, that I gleaned many items of interest
       concerning the history and practices of the Fire-worshipers.
       Other facts were added from time to time during several
       years of frequent association with these singular people, in
       whose glorious though unsuccessful struggles for home and
       liberty it is impossible not to feel an interest.</p>

    <p>As a race, the Parsees are intelligent, active and
    energetic. With business capacities far above the average, they
    are usually successful in amassing wealth, while they are
    extremely benevolent in dispensing their gains for both public
    and private charities. For private benefactions they have,
    however, little call among themselves, since a Parsee pauper
    would be an unheard-of anomaly. Their style of living is
    princely but peculiar. In the reception-rooms of the
    wealthy&mdash;and most of the Parsees in the city of Bombay are
    wealthy&mdash;one finds a rather quaint mingling of Oriental
    luxury and European elegance&mdash;brightly-tinted Persian
    carpets placed in Eastern fashion over divans strewn with
    embroidered cushions and jewel-studded pillows, among which
    recline, with genuine Oriental indolence, some of the members
    of the family; while in another part of the same room half a
    dozen more may be grouped about a table of marble and rosewood,
    occupying velvet chairs that have traveled unmistakably from
    London or Paris. French mirrors and Italian statuettes may have
    for their <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the exquisite mosaics, the
    massive gold vases and the costly bijouterie of the Orient,
    strewn so profusely around as to startle unaccustomed eyes; and
    a genuine Meissonier will be just as likely to be placed side
    by side with a Persian houri as anywhere else. The Parsees
    drive the finest Arab steeds, but on their equipages there is a
    more lavish display of ornament than we should deem quite in
    accordance with good taste. The same is true in regard to
    personal decoration. They wear immense quantities of costly
    jewelry, and nearly all their garments are of silk, generally
    richly embroidered in gold, and often with the addition of
    precious stones. Even little children wear only silk, infants
    from the very first being wrapped in long, loose robes of plain
    white silk that are gradually displaced by others more
    elaborate and costly; while the toilette of a Parsee lady in
    full evening-dress is often of the value of a hundred thousand
    rupees (or forty-five thousand dollars). The female costume
    consists of silk or cotton skirts gathered full round the
    waist, and long, loose robes of silk, lace or muslin, all more
    or less decorated according to the wealth of the wearer. The
    dress of the men is composed of trousers and shirts of white or
    colored silk and long caftans of muslin, with the addition of a
    fanciful little scarf fringed at the ends, and worn jauntily
    across one shoulder and under the other arm. Their caps are
    made of pasteboard covered with gay-colored silk, embroidered
    and studded with precious stones or pearls. The form of a
    Parsee's shirt is a matter of vital importance, both in regard
    to respectability and religion. It must have five seams,
    neither more nor less, and be made to lap on the breast exactly
    in a certain way. Both sexes wear around the body a double
    string, which they loosen when at prayer, and which a Parsee is
    never, under any circumstances, permitted to dispense with. No
    engagement or business transaction is legally binding if by any
    chance this talismanic cord was left off by either party when
    the contract was made. The cord is first placed on children
    when they have completed their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> ninth year, and this serves
       to mark the most important epoch of their lives. Before the
       investiture the eating of food with Christians or heathen
       does not defile the juvenile Parsee, and girls may even go
       about in public with their fathers; but after the bestowal
       of the sacred cord the girls must be kept in seclusion and
       the boys eat only with their own people.</p>

    <p>Only the most liberal Parsees will permit those of other
    creeds to eat under the same roof with themselves, and even
    these never eat at the table with their guests. The table is
    first covered for the visitors, and they are waited on with the
    utmost assiduity, often by the members of the family in
    addition to the servants. When the guests leave the board not
    only is the cloth changed, but the table itself is washed
    before being recovered: salts, castors and other similar
    articles are all emptied and washed, and the table newly laid
    in every particular. Small flat cakes are distributed round the
    board to do service as plates, and the various dishes arranged
    in the centre within reach of all. The family then wash hands
    and faces and the father says a short prayer, after which all
    take their seats and the meal begins. Neither knives nor forks
    are used, but the meat is torn from the bones with the fingers
    only, and with the left hand each one dips, from time to time,
    bread, meat or vegetables into the broth or gravy as he wishes,
    and then tosses it into his mouth, without allowing his fingers
    to touch his lips. This requires some dexterity, and children
    are not permitted at the family board till they have learned
    thus to acquit themselves. If, however, the fingers of any one,
    child or adult, should chance to come in contact with the lips,
    though ever so slightly, he is required to leave the table
    instantly and perform his ablutions over again, or else to take
    the dish from which he was eating to himself, and touch no
    other during the meal. In drinking they exercise the same
    caution, adroitly throwing the liquid into the mouth or throat
    without touching the lips with the cup or glass. The left hand
    is the one with which food is always taken; and the reason
    assigned is, that the right, having of necessity to perform
    most labor, is more frequently brought in contact with things
    unclean.</p>

    <p>I once made a voyage with an American lady and gentleman in
    a Bombay ship that was owned and commanded by a wealthy Parsee
    merchant, though the real sailing-master and mate were
    Englishmen. Our party ate at one table, and the Parsee nabob
    had his own in solitary state. I was then quite a youthful
    wife, and, as my husband was not of the party, the Parsee
    supposed me unmarried, and overwhelmed me with the most gallant
    attentions, among which were frequent invitations to our party
    to dine in his cabin. But, though he would stand at my side all
    the time I was eating, fill my cup or glass with his own hands,
    and urge me to partake of certain dishes that were favorites of
    his own, nothing could induce him to eat or drink in our
    presence, even after we had left the table. And I learned
    afterward that the costly service of rare china, silver and
    glass from which we had eaten and drunk at his table, though
    carefully laid aside, was never again used by the owner. One
    evening, as we sat on the upper deck inhaling the balmy air, he
    invited me to smoke. Of course I declined, and when he insisted
    I told him that it was contrary to the customs of good society
    in our country for ladies to use tobacco in any form. He
    laughed heartily, and said, "Did you suppose I would ask a lady
    to pollute her fragrant breath and dewy lips with so foul a
    thing as vile tobacco? Taste and see." He brought his splendid
    hookah, which I found filled with the "fragrant spices of
    Araby" perfumed with attar of roses, while a long slender tube
    rested in a vessel of rose-water at my feet; and the fumes were
    certainly as agreeable as harmless. But this, my first
    experiment in smoking, cost my Parsee friend three hundred
    dollars, the estimated value of his gold-mounted hookah, with
    its complicated array of tubes and vessels of the same precious
    metal, none of which he durst ever use
    again.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>

    <p>As we sat chatting together in the bright moonlight our ears
    were suddenly greeted by the sound of sweet music&mdash;wild,
    unearthly melody that seemed to rise from the very depths of
    the ocean just below our feet. At first it was only a soft
    trill or a subdued hum, as of a single voice: then followed
    what seemed a full chorus of voices of enchanting sweetness.
    Presently the melody died away in the distance, only, however,
    to burst forth anew after a brief interval. All the time we
    were being regaled with the music we could see nothing to
    enlighten us as to its source, and were inclined to pronounce
    it a trick played by our fun-loving sailing-master. He,
    however, denied all agency in the matter, but counseled us to
    "keep a close look-out on the lee bow" if we wanted to see a
    mermaid. We had noticed a sort of thrilling motion on the lower
    deck, not unlike the sensation produced by the charge of an
    electro-galvanic battery; and this, the Parsee captain gravely
    assured us, was the mermaids' dance, and their efforts to drag
    down our ship. "But I'll catch one of them yet&mdash;see if I
    don't," he said energetically as he caught up something from
    the deck and ran forward, and was presently, with two of the
    Lascars, leaning over the bow. Half an hour afterward he
    returned, and with a merry laugh laid in my lap two little
    brown fish, informing me that they were singing-fish, and that
    the music we had heard had been produced by shoals of these
    tiny vocalists then clinging to the bottom of our ship. Our
    Parsee friend told me that the Arabs and Persians always speak
    of the singing-fish as "tiny women of the sea;" but he had
    never heard our version of their long hair, and their twining
    it about hapless sailors to drag them down to their coral
    caverns beneath the ocean's wave. He showed me how to preserve
    the fish by drying in the sun after repeated anointings with an
    aromatic oil, which he gave me for the purpose; and I have
    still in my cabinet these two specimens as a reminder of the
    incident.</p>

    <p>The manner in which the Parsees dispose of their dead seems
    to us too shocking to be tolerated by a people so gentle and
    refined. But they have grown familiar with a custom that,
    generation after generation, has been observed by their race
    till it has ceased to be repugnant. They call it "consigning
    the dead to the element of air." For this purpose they have
    roofless enclosures, the walls of which are twenty-five or
    thirty feet high, and within are three biers&mdash;one each for
    men, women and children. Upon these the bodies of the dead are
    laid, and fastened down with chains or iron bands. Presently
    birds of prey, so numerous within the tropics and always
    waiting to devour, pounce upon the corpse and quickly tear the
    flesh from the bones, while the skeleton remains intact. This
    is afterward deposited in a pit dug within the same enclosure,
    and which remains open till completely filled up with bones;
    after which another is dug, and when the enclosure can
    conveniently contain no more pits a new one is selected and
    prepared. None but priests and bearers of the dead may enter,
    or even look into, these walled cemeteries. The priests, by
    virtue of their holy office, are preserved from defilement, but
    the bearers are men set apart for this express purpose, and
    they are considered so unclean that they may not enter under
    the roof of any other Parsee or salute him on the street. If in
    passing a bearer do but touch one's clothes accidentally, he is
    subject to a heavy fine, while he who has been thus
    contaminated must bathe his entire person and burn every
    article of raiment he wore at the time of his defilement.</p>

    <p>I was anxious to visit one of their temples, but this, Sir
    Jamsetjee assured me, was impossible, as none but the initiated
    are allowed even to approach the entrance, still less to get a
    glimpse of what is passing within. He, however, volunteered the
    information that, so far as the sanctuary itself was concerned,
    there was little to be seen, only naked walls, bare floors, and
    an altar upon which burns the sacred fire brought with the
    Parsees from Persia, and which, he said, had never been
    extinguished since it was kindled by Zoroaster from the sun
    four thousand years ago. Of the form of service I could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> not induce the baronet to
       speak, but I learned afterward from my ship-friend that the
       altar is enclosed by gratings, within which none but the
       priest may enter. He goes in every day to tend "the eternal
       fire," when he must remain for the space of an hour,
       repeating certain invocations, with a bundle of rods in his
       hand to repel any unclean spirits that should venture to
       approach the sacred fire. Meanwhile, the assembled
       multitudes prostrate themselves without and offer up their
       silent adoration. "Yet, after all," musingly said the
       Parsee, "the universe is the throne of the invisible God, of
       whom fire is but the emblem, and we worship Him most
       acceptably with our eyes fixed on the east when the sun
       rides forth at morning in his celestial chariot of fire."
       This form of worship those curious in such matters may see
       on any bright morning at Bombay, where whole crowds of
       Parsee men, women and children rush out at sunrise to greet
       the king of day and offer up their morning oblations. I was
       not surprised at the avowed preference of my Parsee friends
       for out-door worship, since it is well known that the
       ancient Persians not only permitted few temples to be
       erected to their gods, and held in abhorrence all painted
       and graven images, but they laid it to the charge of the
       Greeks, as a daring impiety, that "they shut up their gods
       in shrines and temples, like puppets in a cabinet, when all
       created things were open to them and the wide world was
       their dwelling-place." It was probably religious zeal, even
       more than revenge against the Greeks, that induced the
       burning of the temple at Athens by Xerxes, led on, as he may
       have been, by the fanatical zeal of the Magi who accompanied
       him.</p>

    <p>Plutarch speaks of the Persians, in common with the
    Chaldeans and Egyptians, as worshipers of the sun under the
    name of Mithra, whom they regarded as standing between Ormuzd,
    "the author of good," and Ahriman, "the author of evil,"
    occupied alternately in aiding the former and subduing the
    latter. So do the Parsees of our own day regard him; and their
    only hope for the ultimate triumph of Ormuzd is in constant
    sacrifices and prayers and propitiatory offerings to the sun as
    the fire that is to burn out and utterly consume all evil from
    our earth. Fire is to the Parsees now, as it has ever been, the
    holiest of all holy things, carried about by princes and great
    men for safety; by warriors, as that which is to give them the
    victory over their foes; and by all, as their sole and
    ever-present deity. Sir Jamsetjee assured me that the
    <i>intelligent</i> Parsees regard the sun and fire as only the
    symbols that are to remind them of the God they worship. But
    there can be no doubt that the mass of the Parsees literally
    worship the sun and the "sacred fire;" and hence arise the
    utter repugnance many of them have to celebrating their
    religious rites within closed walls, and the decided preference
    ever shown for out-door worship. I have often heard them say
    that the Fire-god shows his aversion to confinement by drooping
    when he is shut up, and growing vigorous just in proportion as
    free scope is given him. The sun appears everywhere on the
    shields and armor of the ancient Persians, as on some of the
    old-time monuments that have come down to us; while
    occasionally Mithra is depicted as a youthful hero, with high
    Persian cap, his knee on a prostrate bull, into whose heart he
    seems plunging a dagger&mdash;symbolically, "the power of evil"
    in complete subjection to the victorious sun, and about to be
    for ever annihilated.</p>

    <p>Zoroaster (called by the Persians <i>Zerduscht</i>) was not,
    the Parsees say, the <i>founder</i> of their sect, but only the
    reviser and perfecter of the system as it now exists among
    them. Living in the reign of Darius Hystaspes, he was the
    contemporary, probably an associate, of the prophet Daniel.
    Before the advent of this reformer the Magi acknowledged two
    great First Causes&mdash;i.e., the light and the darkness, the
    former the author of all good, the latter of every evil, moral
    and physical&mdash;and these they believed were at perpetual
    war with each other. Zoroaster taught, as he may have learned
    from Daniel, that there was One
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> greater still, who created
       both the light and the darkness, making both to subserve His
       own will. He also inculcated the duty of building temples
       for the preservation of the sacred fire from storm and
       tempest, when "by sudden extinction of the light the powers
       of darkness do gain often a signal victory." The Parsees
       hold in supreme veneration the name of Zoroaster as the most
       noted of all their Magi for wisdom and virtue. They believe
       that the sacred fire was lighted by him miraculously from
       the sun&mdash;that it has burned steadily ever since, and
       can never go out till it has consumed all evil from the
       earth and the good has become universally triumphant. They
       claim also that from the reforms wrought by Zoroaster there
       was never the slightest change in any of their observances
       until about twelve centuries ago, when Persia was overrun
       and conquered by the Mohammedan Arabs. But not the fiercest
       persecution could induce the Fire-worshipers to change their
       religion for that of the Koran. Preferring liberty and their
       altars in a foreign land to the alternative of apostasy or
       persecution at home, the aboriginal Persian inhabitants fled
       to other lands, settling immense colonies in Surat and
       Bombay, where their descendants form in our day a large and
       valuable element of the population. Their integrity,
       industry and enterprise are proverbial all over the East;
       and while they live strictly apart from all other races, the
       Parsees are never wanting in sympathy and help for those who
       need them. Dwelling amid nations who are almost universally
       destitute of veracity, the Parsees are eminently truthful;
       surrounded by polygamists and sensualists, they maintain
       habits of purity and virtue; and accustomed to every-day
       association with those who make a boast of cheating, my
       memory fails to recall the case of a single Fire-worshiper
       who was not strictly upright and honorable in his
       dealings.</p>

    <p>Commencing with the worship of the sun, and of fire as his
    emblem, the Parsee grew into a sort of reverence for the
    elements of air, earth and water. The air must not be
    contaminated by foul odors, and of necessity no filth could be
    tolerated anywhere in house, street or suburb; and to this
    reverence for the purity of the atmosphere may be traced the
    absolute cleanliness for which Fire-worshipers are everywhere
    noted. As the earth must receive no defilement, the Parsees
    would deem it sacrilege to deposit therein their dead for
    corruption and decay; and hence have doubtless originated their
    strange rites of sepulture, as they believe that the body is
    thus more readily and rapidly reduced to its original elements.
    Streams of water, even the tiniest rivulets, are deemed too
    holy to be desecrated by washing or spitting in them, and still
    less would they make the water the receptacle of offal of any
    sort. To each of these elements, as well as to the fire, the
    Parsees still make oblations on their high-days. It is true
    that their ceremonies now are less imposing than those
    described by Xenophon, when a thousand head of cattle were
    immolated at a single festival, four beautiful bulls presented
    to Jupiter, or the sky, and a magnificent chariot, drawn by
    white horses crowned with flowers and wearing a golden yoke,
    was offered to the sun; while the king in his chariot was
    escorted by princes and great nobles, two thousand spearmen
    marching on either side, and three hundred sceptre-bearers,
    armed with javelins and mounted on splendidly-caparisoned
    horses, bringing up the rear. But those jubilant days have
    passed: the Fire-worshipers are in exile, and have no king to
    lead them, either in battle against their foes or in triumphal
    processions in honor of their gods. Yet is Parseeism not dead,
    nor even on the decrease. Sacrifices, numerous and costly, are
    still piled upon their altars, the finest cattle are dedicated
    to their gods, the flesh being cut up and roasted for the
    people, while the Magi cast the caul and a portion of the fat
    into the fire as emblematic of the souls of the victims being
    imbibed by the gods, while the grosser portions are
    rejected.</p>

    <p>The sacrifices and those who offer them are always crowned
    with flowers, but the pontifical robes of the Magi, though of
    pure white silk, are severely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> plain in style and utterly
       devoid of ornament. In their lives the Magi claim to
       practice a rigid asceticism, making the earth their bed and
       subsisting wholly on fruit, vegetables and bread, besides
       submitting to frequent painful penances from fasting,
       scourging and the endurance of fatiguing exercises. "Wine,
       women and flesh" they are commanded to eschew as "special
       abominations to those who aspire to minister before the
       gods." The most remarkable feast of the ancient Parsees was
       one called by them the "sack-feast." On the appointed day a
       condemned malefactor was clothed in royal robes, seated on a
       kingly throne and the sceptre of regal power placed in his
       hand. Princes and people bowed the knee in mock homage
       before this king of a day, and he was suffered to glut his
       appetite with all manner of sensual delights till the sun
       went down, and then he was cruelly beaten with rods, and
       forthwith executed. (Were the crown and sceptre, the purple
       robe and mock reverence, that were the antecedents of the
       Redeemer's crucifixion, a reproduction of this barbarous
       custom?) The modern Parsees, though recognizing this feast
       as a legitimate part of their worship, say that they have
       not observed it since their flight from Persia in the eighth
       century, because since then, being under a foreign yoke,
       they have had no jurisdiction over human life, and durst not
       sacrifice even those who chanced to be in their power. This
       may be one reason for the renunciation of this barbarous
       practice of the olden time, but there has been wonderful
       progress in civilization during the last twelve hundred
       years; and certain it is that scenes of cruelty that suited
       the ferocious tastes of the eighth century could not
       possibly be repeated in the nineteenth.</p>

    <h2>OUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.</h2>

    <h3>A SWEDISH PROVINCIAL THEATRE.</h3>

    <p>It is not so magnificent as the Scala and San Carlo, and
    still, after seeing both those famous theatres, I must confess
    I preferred that of Carlstad to either. It is small and
    different in form from the generality: it reminded me, in fact,
    of a hall in a certain New England town where I used to go to
    the panorama as a child. There was a gallery like that in which
    the men and boys sat who tramped the loudest and kissed their
    hands, to the confusion of their neighbors, when the lights
    were turned down to enhance the effect of the burning of
    Moscow; only, at my panorama the gallery was unfashionable on
    account of the noisy male element, whereas at Carlstad it was
    the dress-circle. We&mdash;a party of Americans, the only
    foreigners in the house that night&mdash;occupied
    orchestra-stalls, as I presume the two or three front benches
    in the parquet may be called. There was a white cape in our
    vicinity, as well as one in the balcony; so our seats were
    probably as fashionable as those in the first and only circle;
    but behind us, stretching out to the doors and in under the
    gallery, was a dense mass unrelieved by opera-cloaks of any
    description; and that was the region of the
    unpretending&mdash;-of those who came simply to enjoy, to see
    and not to be seen.</p>

    <p>As we spent a good part of a day at Carlstad, I should,
    perhaps, relate something more of the place than merely how we
    went to the theatre there; but that delightful evening effaced
    all other impressions, and after the interval that has since
    elapsed <i>Fleur de Th&eacute;</i> and our commissioner are the
    only things that have retained somewhat of their original
    savor.</p>

    <p>The railway from Stockholm to Christiania ceased at Carlstad
    on Lake <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> Wener, which gave us a
       day's drive to Arvika to strike the track again; and while
       we stood consulting where we were to get carriages, and
       whether we should go directly on, there came up a
       flourishing specimen of the genus <i>valet de place</i>, who
       took possession of us and laid out a plan that he had
       apparently prepared over night for our especial benefit. It
       is a way those persons have, and one that gives them a
       tremendous advantage over travelers weakened by a long
       journey, that they act as if they were there by appointment
       to meet you, or as if you had telegraphed precisely what you
       wished to do, and they were merely carrying out your
       intentions. "You want to go to the Black Eagle Hotel: I take
       you there. You would like to dine: you can have dinner at
       the hotel, or I shall show you a nice restaurant." We had
       not expected to find a member of the great European
       brotherhood just there in a little town in the heart of
       Sweden, and, taken unawares, fell an easy prey. However,
       they do not invariably succeed in that way: sometimes, if
       their officiousness is excessive, their English very
       exasperating and the traveler a little fractious as well as
       tired, they get the tables turned on them. A lady just
       arrived at Genoa, when halfway to the hotel with one of
       these persuasive personages snatched her bag out of his hand
       and walked into the rival albergo because he said with an
       aggravating accent, "I sall get you a ticket for de
       steam-er." "No you sha'n't, either: I have got it myself,"
       she said; and so they parted company, to his infinite
       amazement. My friend&mdash;it was a friend of
       mine&mdash;turned back, on second thoughts, to offer the man
       something for having carried her belongings, but he put on
       offended dignity and declared that he didn't want her money.
       She was rather sorry afterward that he didn't do violence to
       his feelings and take it; and so, no doubt, was he.</p>

    <p>Our Carlstad commissioner beguiled the length of the way to
    the inn, at which we were a little inclined to grumble, by
    pointing out everything of note in our walk through the town.
    We had been reading up in the train, and knew that Carlstad was
    the capital of a district, had five thousand inhabitants, and
    was nearly destroyed by fire in 1865; but he, a son of the
    place, and seeing in his mind's eye its rising glory when the
    railroad should be completed, did not let us off with that. We
    had to look and admire just where he told us. "Wide streets,"
    he would say in his finely-chopped English. "Houses all very
    high&mdash;new since the fire. See here! there's the
    telegraph-office."</p>

    <p>At which, to answer in the style he understood best, we must
    have responded, "Oh, I say! Well. Very good! All right!"</p>

    <p>"You shall go to the theatre if you want to," he remarked at
    last, in that sweet, protecting way peculiar to his class from
    the habitual confounding of <i>can, shall</i> and <i>will</i>,
    and that put us into good humor directly. To go to the theatre
    would be just the thing.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, everybody goes," he said. It was a Danish
    company&mdash;very good actors&mdash;very pretty piece; but we
    rather expected to care more for the <i>everybody</i> than
    either the piece or the actors; and so it proved.</p>

    <p>We went early, and established ourselves in the
    orchestra-stalls, as already stated, while our guardian
    accepted an unpretending seat for himself, where he remained in
    readiness to tow us home after the performance. And then the
    spectators began to come in, and positively some of the very
    people who used to be at the panorama. I know there was a lady
    in front of me, in Mechanic Hall, who wore her hair in just
    such a little knot&mdash;<i>pug</i> is, I think, the classic
    name for that coiffure&mdash;and her dress cut as low in the
    throat and adorned with precisely such a self-embroidered
    collar as the lady rejoiced in who occupied the seat before me
    at the theatre. That she was one of the fashionables of
    Carlstad could be seen in the lofty pose of that pug, and in
    the curious structure of ribbon and lace that sat astride of it
    and hung down at each side. Her husband, a small, rather
    dried-up gentleman, had the look of a town oracle who was
    oppressed at home, and her daughter
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"
       id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span> was one of the prettiest
       girls in the house. The overgrown boy, the son and heir, was
       not pretty: he sat beside his sister and kept nudging her. I
       could not exactly understand what he said in Swedish, but I
       know it must have been of this nature: "There's Jim Davis
       over there. Look, sister, look!"</p>

    <p>Sister only glanced at him with a reproving air of "Don't
    push me so," and then gazed steadfastly in the other direction;
    but she was not left long in peace. Tom's elbow began again in
    a minute: "He's looking right at you, all the time. You'd
    better turn round and bow to him." And the color would creep up
    in her cheeks, do all she could to prevent it, so that she had
    to lean across mamma and say something to her father, just so
    as not to bow to Mr. Davis, which would have been such a simple
    thing to do, after all.</p>

    <p>Everybody who came in nodded and spoke to everybody else,
    and then shook hands across the seats; and we felt quite out of
    our element under the inquiring but superior glances that fell
    to our lot. It was all very well for us to make our little
    observations and smile at each other on the sly: we had the
    consciousness all the while of not belonging to the first
    society in Carlstad, and of being viewed as intruders in that
    select circle.</p>

    <p>We had been studying one family party after another as the
    seats filled around us, for the audience collected by families,
    when, with a little rustle and stir attending her progress, and
    a whispering behind her as she advanced, the Bride appeared,
    for she had arrived from Stockholm by our train. It was the
    first time any one had seen her since she started on the
    wedding-tour, and the bows and smiles she dealt out on every
    side were not to be numbered. Our pretty girl got
    one&mdash;they were school-friends&mdash;and the horrid boy
    another, which he barely answered with a solemn nod of his
    head, being as shy of her, apparently, in her blue silk and
    white cape, as his sister was of Mr. Davis. It was really a
    very pretty dress of the Bride's, and one that made our
    traveling costumes look uncommonly shabby: it was taken up
    behind in the approved style, and only needed a bustle to have
    been truly effective. Doubtless she had seen plenty of those
    articles in Stockholm, only her husband said, "I hope, dear,
    you will never put on one of those horrid things;" and she told
    him certainly not if he did not like them; but I think she
    found afterward she needed one for that blue dress, and sent
    for it at the first opportunity. The young husband was not got
    up for show, knowing very well that no one would mind him, but
    he looked beamingly happy; and if he was not in a dress-coat
    with a flower in his buttonhole, like the
    <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise
    or the Italiens, he understood how they use an opera-glass
    there. The glass was a new acquisition that he had brought home
    with him, and after practicing with it at the Royal Theatre in
    the capital, he was fully prepared to stand up between the
    acts, with his arm behind him in a negligently graceful
    attitude, and study the balcony. His acquaintances there must
    have found it rather embarrassing, for it was not a usual thing
    in Carlstad to look at one's friends through an opera-glass: he
    was the only person who did it, and they probably all talked
    about it when they went home.</p>

    <p>We were so occupied with our surroundings that we hardly
    thought of the piece, though it was given with considerable
    spirit, if I remember rightly. The sailors were fine, jolly
    tars, and the Chinese ladies and gentlemen toddled about in
    flowered dressing-gowns and talked with their thumbs, as it
    would appear the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire usually
    do; but the house did not allow itself to be betrayed into
    unseemly enthusiasm. There was an involuntary laugh now and
    then, and once somebody said <i>bravo</i>, but as a general
    thing a discreet reticence prevailed, and the actors might have
    gone through the piece on their heads in an extravagant desire
    to elicit signs of approval: they would only have received a
    cool little round of applause when the curtain fell.</p>

    <p>We, at all events, had no hesitation in telling the
    commissioner that we had enjoyed ourselves immensely; and so,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> it appeared, had he. He was
       even bold enough to call it a very fine company, and as we
       walked back to the hotel at half-past nine in broad
       daylight, he told us what they were going to play the next
       evening, possibly in the hope that we should stay for it and
       he should get another seat. That was out of the question,
       however, sorry as we were to disappoint him. He had to tuck
       us into the carriage the following day, and let us drive
       away and leave him bereft of his charges. "You shall have a
       good ride," were his parting words, kind and fatherly as he
       was to the last; and so we had. But we found no one again to
       care for us so tenderly as our old friend, nor did any one
       take us to the theatre throughout the remainder of the
       journey. G.H.</p>

    <h3>VENETIAN CAFF&Egrave;S.</h3>

    <p>It is years since so lovely an autumn as that of 1874 has
    been seen in Europe: people say not since the last great comet
    year, and they credit the erratic visitor of last summer with
    the exceptional beauty of the weather. As in the case of other
    marked comet years, the vintages of which still bring
    extraordinary prices, Italy has had exceptionally fine harvests
    of all kinds this year. The grain has been abundant, the
    vintage has been superb, the olives have escaped the danger of
    unseasonable frosts, and the still more important crop of
    foreigners seems to be pretty well assured. The charming
    weather in October and November made the interesting blossoms
    sprout plentifully; and boat-loads and train-loads came in with
    an abundance promising an unusually fine winter for <i>la bella
    Italia</i>. Venice, indeed, may be said to have pretty well
    housed her crop in this kind already. It has been a magnificent
    one, and the Queen of the Adriatic admits that due homage has
    been done to her. The <i>forestieri</i> season sets in earlier
    in her case than in her sister cities. The real "Carnival de
    Venice" is in August, September and October now-a-days, let the
    calendar say what it may. Some flaunting of gaudy-colored
    calico, some dancing on the Piazza of St. Mark, there may be on
    the eve of Lent in obedience to old usages, but the dancing
    that really glads the Italian heart is the dancing for which
    the <i>forestiere</i> pays the piper, and the true Lenten time
    is that when his beneficent presence is wanting.</p>

    <p>Venice, then, has already brought her Carnival to a
    conclusion; and it has been a splendid one. English, Americans,
    Germans, all came in shoals&mdash;all thronged the galleries,
    the churches and the palaces in the morning, sauntered or
    bathed on the outer shore of the Lido in the afternoon, and met
    at Florian's in the evening. "What is Florian's?" will be asked
    by those who have never been at Venice&mdash;by some such, at
    least. For probably the fame of the celebrated
    <i>caff&egrave;</i> may have traveled across the Atlantic, just
    as many who have never crossed it westward are no strangers to
    the name of Delmonico. Florian's, however, in any case,
    deserves a word of recognition. It is the principal, largest
    and most fashionable caff&egrave; on the Piazza di San Marco.
    But the singular and curious specialty of the place is that it
    has never been closed&mdash;no, not for five minutes&mdash;day
    or night, for a period of more than a hundred and thirty years!
    Probably it is the only human habitation of any sort on the
    face of the globe of which that could be said.</p>

    <p>But the caff&egrave; in itself is in many respects a
    specialty of Venetian life, and has been so since the days of
    Goldoni. The readers of his comedies, so abundantly rich in
    local coloring, will not have failed to observe that the
    caff&egrave; plays a larger part in the life of Venice than is
    the case in any other city. Probably no Venetian passes a
    single day without visiting once at least, if not oftener, his
    accustomed caff&egrave;. Men of business write their letters
    and arrange their meetings there. Men of pleasure know that
    they shall find their peers there. Mere loafers take their
    seats there, and gaze at the stream of life, as it flows past
    them, for hours together. And, most marked specialty of all,
    Venice is the only city in Italy where the native female
    aristocracy frequents the caff&egrave;. Indeed, I know no place
    in all the Peninsula where so large an amount of Italian beauty
    may be seen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> as among the fashionable
       crowd at Florian's on a brilliant midsummer moonlight
       night.</p>

    <p>Venice is of all the cities in the world the one which those
    who have never seen it know best. The peculiarities of it are
    so marked and so unlike anything else in the world, and the
    graphic representations of every part of the city are so
    numerous and so admirably accurate, that every traveler finds
    it to be exactly what he was prepared to see, and can hardly
    fancy that he sees the Queen of the Adriatic for the first
    time. I may therefore assume, perhaps, that my readers are
    acquainted with the appearance of that most matchless of city
    spaces, the Piazza di San Marco. They will readily call to mind
    the long series of arcades that form the two long sides of the
    parallellogram which has the gorgeous front of St. Mark's
    church occupying the entirety of one of the shorter sides.
    Well, about halfway up the length of the piazza six of the
    arches on the right hand of one facing St. Mark's church are
    occupied by the celebrated caff&egrave;. The six never-closed
    rooms, corresponding each with one of the arches of the arcade,
    are very small, and would not suffice to accommodate a
    twentieth part of the throng which finds itself at Florian's
    quite as a matter of course every fine summer's night. But
    nobody thinks of entering these smartly-furnished little
    cabinets save for breakfast or during the hours of the day.
    Some take their evening ice or coffee on the seats under the
    arcade, either immediately in front of the cabinets or around
    the pillars which support the arches, and thus have an
    opportunity of observing the never-ceasing and ever-varying
    stream of life that flows by them under the arcade. But the
    vast majority of the crowd place themselves on chairs arranged
    around little tables set out on the flags of the piazza. A
    hundred or so of these little tables are placed in long rows
    extending far out into the piazza, and far on either side
    beyond the extent of the six arches which are occupied by the
    caff&egrave; itself. A London or New York policeman would have
    his very soul revolted, and conclude that there must be
    something very rotten indeed in the state of a city in which
    the public way could be thus encumbered and no cry of "move on"
    ever heard. Assuredly, it is public ground which Florian, in
    the person of his nineteenth-century representative, thus
    occupies with his tables and chairs. Probably, if a Venetian
    were asked by what right he does so, the question would seem to
    him much as if one asked by what right the tide covers the
    shallows of the lagoon. It always has been so. It is in the
    natural order of things. And how could Venice live without
    Florian's?</p>

    <p>But it is not Florian's alone which is thus a trespasser on
    the domain of the public. The other less celebrated
    caff&egrave;s do the same thing. One immediately opposite to
    Florian's, on the other side of the
    piazza&mdash;Quadri's&mdash;has almost as large a spread of
    chairs and tables as Florian himself. But it is a curious
    instance of the permanence of habits at Venice, that though at
    Quadri's the articles supplied are quite as good, and the
    prices exactly the same, the fashionable world never deserts
    Florian's. The only difference between the two establishments,
    except this one of their customers, that is perceptible to the
    naked eye, is that at Quadri's beer is served, while Florian
    ignores the existence of that plebeian beverage, which
    assuredly was never heard of in Venice in the days when he
    began his career and formed his habitudes.</p>

    <p>I am tempted to endeavor to give the reader some picture of
    the scene on the piazza on a night when (as is the case almost
    every other evening) a military band is playing in the middle
    of the open space, and the cosmopolitan crowd is assembled in
    force&mdash;to describe the wonderful surroundings of the
    scene, the charm of the quietude broken by no sound of hoof or
    of wheel, the soft and tempered light, the gay clatter, athwart
    which comes every fifteen minutes the solemn mellow tone of the
    great clock of St. Mark with importunate warning that another
    pleasant quarter of an hour has drifted away down the stream of
    time. It is a scene that tempts the pen. But the well-dressed
    portion of mankind <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> is very similar in all
       countries and under all circumstances, and perhaps my
       readers may be more interested in a few traits of the
       popular life of Venice, which the magnificent Piazza of St.
       Mark is not the best place for studying, for some of the
       most characteristic phases of it are absolutely banished
       thence. The strolling musician or singer, who may be heard
       every night in other parts of the city, never plies his
       trade on the piazza. Mendicancy, which is more rife at
       Venice, I am sorry to say, than in any other Italian city,
       except perhaps Naples, is not tolerated on the piazza.</p>

    <p>But if we wish for a good specimen of the truly popular life
    of Venice, it will not be necessary to wander far from the
    great centre of the piazza. Coming down the Piazzetta, or
    Little Piazza, which opens out of the great square at one end,
    and abuts on the open lagoon opposite the island of St. George
    at the other, and turning round the corner of the ducal palace,
    we cross the bridge over the canal, which above our heads is
    bridged by the "Bridge of Sighs," with its "palace and a prison
    on each hand," as Byron sings, and find ourselves on the "Riva
    dei Schiavoni"&mdash;the quay at which the Slavonic vessels
    arrived, and arrive still. The quay is a very broad one, by far
    the broadest in Venice, paved with flagstones, and teeming with
    every characteristic form of Venetian life from early morning
    till late into the night. There are two or three hotels
    frequented by foreigners on the Riva, for the situation facing
    the open lagoon is an exceptionally good one; and there are
    three or four caff&egrave;s at which the cosmopolitan and not
    too aristocratic visitor may get an excellent cup of coffee
    (for the Venetians, thanks to their long connection with the
    East, know what coffee is, and will not take chiccory or other
    such detestable substitutes in lieu of it) for the modest
    charge of thirteen centimes&mdash;just over two cents&mdash;and
    study as he drinks it the moving and ever-amusing scenes
    enacted before his eyes. His neighbor perhaps will be an old
    gentleman, the very type of the old "pantaloon" whose mask was
    in the old comedy supposed to be the impersonation of Venice.
    There are the long, slender and rather delicately-cut features
    terminating in a long, narrow and somewhat protruding chin; the
    high cheek-bones, the lank and sombre cheeks, the high nose,
    the dark bright eye under its bushy brow. He is very thin, very
    seedy, and evidently <i>very</i> poor. But he salutes you, as
    you take your seat beside him, with the air of an ex-member of
    "The Ten;" his ancient hat and napless coat are carefully
    brushed; his outrageously high shirt-collar and voluminous
    unstarched neckcloth, after the fashion of a former generation,
    though as yellow as saffron, are clean; and his poor old boots
    as irreproachable as blacking&mdash;which can do much, but,
    alas! not all things&mdash;can make them. His expenditure of a
    penny will entitle him not only to a cup of coffee, as
    aforesaid, but also to a glass of fresh water, which has been
    turned to an opaline color by the shaking into it of a few
    drops of something which the waiter drops from a bottle with
    some contrivance at its mouth, the effect of which is to cause
    only a drop or two of the liquor, whatever it may be, to come
    out at each shake. Our old friend is also entitled, in virtue
    of his expenditure, to occupy the chair he sits on for as many
    hours as he shall see fit to remain in it. And after the
    coffee, which must be drunk while hot, has been despatched, the
    sippings of the opaline mixture aforesaid may be protracted
    indefinitely while he enjoys the cool evening-breezes from the
    lagoon, the perfection of <i>dolce far niente</i>, and the
    amusement the life of the Riva never fails to afford him. An
    itinerant vender of little models of gondolas and bracelets and
    toys made out of shells comes by, seeking a customer among the
    folk assembled at the caff&egrave;. He does not address
    Pantaloon, for of course he knows that there is nothing to be
    done in that line with him. But spying with a hawk's glance a
    <i>forestiere</i> among the crowd, he strolls up to him,
    holding up one of his gimcrack bracelets daintily&mdash;and he
    thinks temptingly, poor fellow!&mdash;between his finger and
    thumb. "Un franco! Un sol franco! &egrave; una beleza per una
    contesa!" ("One franc! <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> only one franc! It would be
       beautiful on the arm of a countess!") he murmurs in his soft
       lisping Venetian, which abolishes all double consonants, and
       supplies their place by prolonging the soft liquid sound of
       the preceding vowel. One franc! It is wonderful how the
       thing, worthless as it is, can be made even by the most
       starving fingers for such a price. Yet after dangling his
       toy for a minute, and gazing, oh, so wistfully! the while
       out of his big haggard eyes, he says, "Seventy-five
       centimes! half a franc!" and still lingers ere he turns away
       with a sigh, a weary movement of his emaciated figure and a
       longing look on his poor hollow face that make one feel that
       the drama we are witnessing is not all comedy. But it is all
       supremely interesting to our neighbor, Si'or Pantaleone. He
       has been keenly watching the attempted deal, and no doubt
       wished that his countryman might succeed. But there was no
       element of tragedy in the matter for him, a condition of
       semi-starvation is too much an ordinary, every-day and
       normal spectacle. He looked on more as a retired merchant
       might look on at the progress of a bargain for the delivery
       of a shipload of grain. Presently, a middle-aged woman and a
       girl of some fourteen years station themselves in front of
       the audience seated outside the caff&egrave;. The elder
       woman has a guitar, and the girl a violin and some sheets of
       music in her hand. The woman has her wonderful wealth of
       black hair grandly dressed and as shining as oil can make
       it. She has large gilt earrings in her ears, a heavy coral
       necklace, and a gaudy-colored shawl in good condition.
       Whatever might be beneath and below this is in dark
       shadow&mdash;"et sic melius situm." She is not starved,
       however, for, as she prepares to finger her guitar, she
       shows a well-nourished and not ill-formed arm. The young
       girl has one of those pale, delicate, oval faces so common
       in Venice: she also has a good shawl&mdash;an amber-colored
       one&mdash;which so sets off the olive-colored complexion of
       her face as to make her a perfect picture. This couple do
       not in any degree assume an attitude of appealing <i>ad
       misericordiam</i>. They pose themselves <i>en artistes</i>.
       The girl sets about arranging her music in a business-like
       way, and then they play the well-known air of "La Stella
       Confidente," the little violinist really playing remarkably
       well. Then the elder woman comes round with a little tin
       saucer for our contributions. No slightest word or look of
       disappointment or displeasure follows the refusal of those
       who give nothing. The saucer is presented to each in turn. I
       supposed that the application to Si'or Pantaleone was an
       empty form. But no. That retired gentleman could still find
       wherewithal to patronize the fine arts, and dropped a
       centime&mdash;the fifth part of a cent&mdash;into the dish
       with the air of a prince bestowing the grand cross of the
       Golden Fleece. Then comes a dealer in ready-made trousers,
       which Pantaloon examines curiously and cheapens. Then a body
       of men singing part-songs, not badly, but to some
       disadvantage, as they utterly ignore the braying of half a
       dozen trumpets which are coming along the Riva in advance of
       a body of soldiers returning to some neighboring barracks.
       Then there are fruit-sellers and fish-sellers and
       hot-chestnut dealers, and, most vociferous of all, the
       cryers of "Acqua! acqua! acqua fresca!" There, making its
       way among the numerous small vessels from Dalmatia, Greece,
       etc. moored to the quay of the Schiavoni, comes a boat from
       the Peninsular and Oriental steamer, which arrived this
       morning from Alexandria, with four or five Orientals on
       board. They come on shore, and proceed to saunter along the
       Riva toward the Grand Piazza, while their dark faces and
       brightly-colored garments add an element to the motley scene
       which is perfectly in keeping with old Venetian
       reminiscences.</p>

    <h3>A NEW MEXICAN CHRISTMAS EVE.</h3>

    <p>It is Christmas Eve in Albuquerque. Blazing fagots of
    mesquite-roots placed on the surrounding adobe walls illuminate
    the old church on the plaza. There is a grand <i>baile</i> at
    the fonda, to which we and our "family are most respectfully
    invited." The sounds of music
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> already invite us to the
       ball-room. We enter. The floor is full; a hundred couples
       are gliding through the graceful "Spanish dance," or "slow
       waltz," as it is termed here. Not a few blue-and-gold United
       States uniforms are to be seen in the throng. A
       full-uniformed major-general of volunteers adds the
       &eacute;clat of his epaulettes to the occasion. The ranchos
       have poured in their se&ntilde;oras and se&ntilde;oritas,
       and three rows of the dark-eyed creatures sit ranged around
       the room.</p>

    <p>The Mexican women look their best in a ball-room. Their
    black eyes, black hair and white teeth glisten in the light;
    they are dressed in the gayest of gay colors; ponderous
    ornaments of gold, strongly relieved by their dusk complexions,
    shed around them a rich barbaric lustre. Not that they eschew
    adventitious means to blanch their sun-shadowed tints. For days
    some of the se&ntilde;oras and se&ntilde;oritas have worn a
    mask of a white clayey mixture to give them an ephemeral
    whiteness for this occasion. Those who could procure nothing
    else have worn a pasty vizard kneaded of common clay, to effect
    in some degree a like result by protecting their faces from the
    sun and wind. Should you visit New Mexico, and as you ride
    along slowly in the heat of midday meet a se&ntilde;orita who
    gazes at you with a pair of jet black eyes through a hideous,
    ghastly mask of mud or mortar, do not be frightened from your
    accustomed propriety. The se&ntilde;orita is preparing her
    <i>toilette de bal</i>.</p>

    <p>The New Mexican women cannot be considered pretty, generally
    speaking. In artistic symmetry of feature, in purity of
    complexion, they are not to be compared with our countrywomen.
    These can bear the searching light of day, when delicacy of
    detail can be distinguished and appreciated. Those look their
    best in the artificial light of the ball-room. There the
    blue-black hair, the brilliant black eyes, the well-traced
    eyebrows, the magnificently white and regular teeth, the
    richly-developed forms, produce a general effect before which
    our blond and delicate beauties seem pale and <i>fades</i>. But
    the Mexican's coarser skin&mdash;her <i>teint
    basan&eacute;</i>&mdash;is too plainly visible in the light of
    the sun: you should see her only by the lamps. It is doubtless
    rather from an instinct of coquetry than from any other feeling
    that in the day-time the Mexican women shroud their dusky
    traits in the folds of their <i>rebosas</i>, leaving only one
    pilot eye to look upon the outer world.</p>

    <p>No introductions are necessary at the public bailes. Saunter
    around the room, inspect the show of expectant partners, and
    when you see one who suits your fancy ask her to dance, without
    more ado. If she be not engaged she will at once accept your
    proffered arm. She will not say anything. Ten to one she will
    not breathe a syllable during your evolutions. Conversation is
    not the forte of the se&ntilde;oritas. But she will smile and
    smile, and you will have no reason to complain of her waltzing.
    The Mexican <i>caballero</i>, when he seeks a partner, will not
    put himself out so far as to have any words about it. He merely
    beckons the chosen one, as the sultan might throw the
    handkerchief, and she comes to him at once.</p>

    <p>Each dance concluded, you lead your partner to a sort of bar
    where refreshments are furnished, and ask her whether she will
    take <i>vino</i> or <i>dulces</i>&mdash;wine or candies? She
    will take <i>dulces</i>&mdash;"Gracias, se&ntilde;or!" This is
    <i>de rigueur</i>. You pay for them of course, and conduct her
    to her seat. She pours the <i>dulces</i> into the awaiting
    pocket-handkerchiefs of the old people, her <i>comadres</i>,
    and of her younger brothers and sisters.</p>

    <p>In a little room adjoining the ball-room, with door
    invitingly open, is the shrine of <i>monte</i>. The revelry of
    the ball-room is unheeded by the preoccupied votaries of the
    changeful deity as they sit around the green table watching the
    dealer as he turns the cards, and nervously fingering their
    little piles of red or white "chips." We have no business and
    no pleasure here. Let us merely look in and pass on.</p>

    <p>Waltzes, "round" and "slow," are the <i>pi&egrave;ces de
    r&eacute;sistance</i> of a Mexican baile: quadrilles are not
    relished by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> dusky danseuses. There are
       some New Mexican dances which do not lack prettiness. Of
       these, the Cuna is the most popular. It commences with a
       see-saw movement suggestive of its name&mdash;cuna- or
       cradle-dance. For the rest, the waltz enters much into its
       composition.</p>

    <p>The orchestra generally consists of one or more violins and
    a guitar or two. The New Mexican guitar is strung conversely:
    the base-string is where we put the treble, and <i>vice
    vers&acirc;</i>. The strings are generally struck with the
    thumb-nail or with a piece of horn or wood like the ancient
    <i>plectrum</i>. This produces a harsh metallic sound, without
    any rotundity. Few New Mexican fiddlers or guitar-players are
    capable of playing in any time except dancing time, and the
    character of the baile, funeral and sacred music is the same.
    The only distinction is the addition of a continuous
    <i>tremolo</i> to the latter two, which produces the same
    unpleasant effect on the nerves as a comic song chanted by the
    shaky, cracked, piping and quavering voice of senility. As the
    fiddles invariably play their parts in funerals as well as on
    festive processions, it requires some familiarity with the
    customs of the country to distinguish one from the other. The
    music to-night is much better than the ordinary baile music. A
    native harpist adds the music of his many strings; and not bad
    music either, though he does not know a quaver from a
    semibreve, and his harp is of his own manufacture. The
    sameness, however, caused by playing always and everything in
    the same key is perceptible. But dancing critics are not
    disposed to be very severe.</p>

    <p>The enjoyment of the evening is at high pressure. The
    dancers are swinging, surging, spinning through the Spanish
    dance. Everybody who can find a partner and a place on the
    floor&mdash;there are many who cannot find the latter&mdash;is
    dancing. It is a gay, a brilliant scene. All is going as
    merrily as a whole chime of marriage-bells when a deep and
    solemn peal from the church close by breaks in over the music,
    the laughter and the dancing. It is midnight! It is the
    <i>Noche Buena</i>, and the bell summons the faithful to the
    midnight mass. The effect is electric. The last twirl of the
    waltz is suspended, half executed. The dancers stop as suddenly
    as if they were puppets moved and stilled by the cunning of
    some wire-pulling hand. A general rush is made for the church:
    in a moment the ball-room is empty. The church is filled as
    instantaneously, and the wildly gay dancers of a moment ago are
    now kneeling, hushed and down-bent, in devotional
    attitudes.</p>

    <p>The scene is impressive: the bright ball-toilettes
    contrasted in a "dim religious light," the sudden change of
    place and mood, from gay to grave, from ball-room to sanctuary,
    strikes a stranger's eye with thrilling effect. At the
    conclusion of the service the dancers return to the ball-room,
    to change from grave to gay, and dance <i>ad libitum</i> till
    daylight.</p>

    <h3>ENGLISH BIBLE TRANSLATIONS.</h3>

    <p>The first complete translation of the Bible into our
    language was made about the year 1380 by John de Wycliffe, or
    Wickliffe. There are several manuscript copies of it in the
    Bodleian and other European libraries. This great work unlocked
    the Scriptures to the multitude, or, as one of his antagonists,
    bewailing such an enterprise, worded it, "the gospel pearl was
    cast abroad and trodden under foot." Long before the appearance
    of this translation various versions of portions of the Bible
    had appeared, specimens of which, of every century from the
    reign of Alfred to Chaucer's time, are preserved in the British
    Museum and elsewhere. Sir Thomas More says: "The Holy Byble was
    longe before Wycliffis daies by virtuose and well-learned men
    translated into the English tongue, and by good and godly
    people with devotion and soberness well and reverently read."
    This statement is further corroborated by Foxe, the
    martyrologist, who remarks: "If histories be well examined, we
    shall find both before and after the Conquest, as well before
    John Wickliffe was borne as since, the whole body of the
    Scriptures by sundry men translated into this our country
    tongue." Wycliffe's Bible was first printed at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> Oxford in 1850, previous to
       which the New Testament appeared in 1721 and was reprinted
       in 1810.</p>

    <p>In 1526, William Tyndale completed and published in English
    his translation of the New Testament. He also translated and
    printed the Pentateuch and the book of Jonah, and was preparing
    them for publication when he was put to death in Flanders,
    being strangled and burnt for heresy. Tyndale's translation,
    with his latest revisions (1534), was republished in the
    English Hexapla in 1841. A copy of his translation of the
    Pentateuch which had belonged to Bishop Heber was sold in 1854
    for $795. Four years later another copy sold for within twenty
    dollars of that amount.</p>

    <p>The first English translation of the entire Bible was made
    by Miles Coverdale, who afterward became bishop of Exeter, and
    was printed in folio in the year 1535. In 1538 a second edition
    of Coverdale's Bible was printed at Paris, but the Inquisition
    interfered and committed the whole edition of twenty-five
    hundred copies to the flames. No perfect copy of Coverdale's
    version is known to exist, but one lacking the original
    title-page and first leaf was sold in 1854 for $1725. Another,
    at the Perkins' sale, in June, 1873, brought $2000.</p>

    <p>Two years after the appearance of the first edition of
    Coverdale's Bible, John Rogers, the first martyr in Queen
    Mary's reign, published his version of the Scriptures. He made
    some emendations, but the text is chiefly that of Tyndale and
    Coverdale. It was printed by Grafton and Whitchurch in 1537,
    and the title runs: "The Byble, which is all the holy
    Scripture: in which are contayned the Olde and Newe Testament
    truely and purely translated into Englysh by Thomas Matthew."
    For safety, Rogers assumed the name of Matthew, whence it is
    known as Matthew's Bible. Seven hundred and fifty dollars have
    been paid for a copy.</p>

    <p>The third version of the Bible, known as Taverner's, was
    published in 1539. Richard Taverner was a learned man who
    published many translations during the sixteenth century. Horne
    says of his translation, "This is neither a bare revisal of
    Cranmer's Bible nor a new version, but a kind of intermediate
    work, being a correction of what is called 'Matthew's
    Bible.'"</p>

    <p>The first edition of Cranmer's Bible, the printing of which
    was begun in Paris in 1538 and completed in London in
    1540&mdash;the Inquisition having interposed by imprisoning the
    printers and burning the greater part of the
    impression&mdash;is excessively rare. Cranmer's Bible&mdash;or
    the Great Bible, as it was called&mdash;is Tyndale's,
    Coverdale's and Rogers's translations most carefully revised
    throughout. This was the first sound and authorized English
    version; and as soon as it was perfected a proclamation was
    issued ordering it to be provided for every parish church,
    under a penalty of forty shillings a month. A second edition of
    Cranmer's Bible appeared in 1560, a copy of which brought, at a
    recent sale in England, the sum of $610.</p>

    <p>The Genevan version of the Bible was made by several English
    exiles at Geneva in Queen Mary's reign&mdash;viz., Cole,
    Coverdale, Gilby, Knox, Sampson, Whittingham and
    Woodman&mdash;and was first printed in 1560. It went through
    fifty editions in the course of thirty years. This translation
    was very popular with the Puritan party. In this version the
    first division into verses was made. It is commonly known as
    the "Breeches Bible," from the peculiar rendering of Genesis
    iii. 7&mdash;" breeches of fig-leaves." To the Geneva Bible we
    owe the beautiful phraseology of the admired passage in
    Jeremiah viii. 22. Coverdale, Matthew and Taverner render it,
    "For there is no more treacle at Gilead?" Cranmer, "Is there no
    treason at Gilead?" The Genevan first gave the poetic
    rendering, "Is there no balm in Gilead?"</p>

    <p>In the year 1568 another translation appeared, which is
    indiscriminately known as "Matthew Parker's Bible," the
    "Bishops' Bible" and the "Great English Bible." This version
    was undertaken and carried on under the inspection of Matthew
    Parker, second Protestant archbishop of Canterbury. Of the
    fifteen <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> translators, six were
       bishops, hence this edition is often called the Bishops'
       Bible, though it is sometimes designated the Great English
       Bible, from its being a huge folio volume. In 1569 it was
       published in octavo form. There is a well-preserved copy of
       the first edition of Matthew Parker's Bible in the
       possession of a gentleman residing in New York City. This
       was the authorized version of the Scriptures for forty
       years, when it was superseded by our present English
       Bible.</p>

    <p>The English Roman Catholic College at Rheims issued in the
    year 1582 a translation of the New Testament, known as the
    "Rhemish New Testament." It was condemned by the queen of
    England, and copies imported into that country were seized and
    destroyed. In 1609 the first volume of the Old Testament, and
    in the following year the second volume, were published at
    Douay, hence ever since known as the Douay Bible. Some years
    since Cardinal Wiseman remarked that the names Rhemish and
    Douay, as applied to the current editions, are absolute
    misnomers. The publishers of the edition chiefly used in this
    country state that it is translated from the Latin Vulgate,
    "being the edition published by the English College at Rheims
    A.D. 1582, and at Douay in 1609, as revised and corrected in
    1750, according to the Clementine edition of the Scriptures, by
    the Rt. Rev. Richard Challoner, bishop of Debra, with his
    annotations for clearing up the principal difficulties of Holy
    Writ."</p>

    <p>Theodore Beza translated the New Testament out of the Greek
    into the Latin. This was first published in England in 1574,
    and afterward frequently. In 1576 it was "Engelished" by
    Leonard Tomson, under-secretary to Sir Francis Walsingham, and
    was afterward frequently annexed to the Genevan Old Testament.
    The following is a copy of the title-page of the New Testament,
    <i>verbatim et literatim</i>: "The New Testament of our Lord
    Jesus Christ, translated out of Greeke by Theod Beza: with
    brief summaries and expositions upon the hard places by the
    said authour, <i>Ioach Amer and P Loseler Vallerius</i>.
    Engelished by L Tomson. Together with the Annotations of <i>Fr
    Junius</i> upon the Revelation of S. John. Imprinted at London
    by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queene's
    Most Excellent Majestie&mdash;1599." The volume opens with a
    primitive version of the Psalms in verse, then follow the Old
    Testament, the Apocrypha and the New Testament, as in Bibles of
    the present day.</p>

    <p>The version of the Scriptures now in use among Protestants
    was translated by the authority of King James I., and published
    in 1611. Fifty-four learned men were appointed to accomplish
    the work of revision, but from death or other causes seven of
    the number failed to enter upon it. The remaining forty-seven
    were ranged under six divisions, different portions of the
    Bible being assigned to each division. They entered upon their
    task in 1607, and after three years of diligent labor the work
    was completed. This version was generally adopted, and the
    former translations soon fell into disuse. The authors of King
    James's version of the Bible included the most learned divines
    of the day; one of whom was master of Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
    Chaldee, Syriac and fifteen modern languages.</p>

    <p>Among other rare and highly-coveted editions of the Bible is
    one printed in England in the seventeenth century, in which the
    important word <i>not</i> was omitted in the seventh
    commandment, from which circumstance it has ever since been
    known as "The Adulterer's Bible." Another edition, known as the
    Pearl Bible, appeared about the same time, filled with errata,
    a single specimen of which will suffice: "Know ye not the
    ungodly <i>shall inherit</i> the kingdom of God?" Bibles were
    once printed which affirmed that "all Scripture was profitable
    for <i>de</i>struction;" while still another edition of the
    sacred volume is known as the "Vinegar Bible," from the erratum
    in the title to the twentieth chapter of St. Luke, in which
    "Parable of the Vineyard" is printed "Parable of the
    Vinegar."</p>

    <h3>LITERATURE OF THE DAY.</h3>

    <p>Life and Labours of Mr. Brassey, 1805-1870. By Sir Arthur
    Helps, K.C.B. Boston: Roberts Brothers.</p>

    <p>The "captains of industry," who constitute in our day so
    distinct and notable a class of worthies, are doubtless as well
    entitled to have their achievements recorded and their fame
    sounded throughout the lands as were the doughty men of war who
    of old were deemed the only fitting heroes of chronicle and
    epic. Few of them, however, can hope to have their deeds
    commemorated by a "veray parfit, gentle knight"&mdash;of the
    quill, not of the sword, albeit the letters which he writes
    after his name would once have indicated the possession of
    military rank and distinction. Sir Arthur Helps is not a man of
    few words or of a very stern or passionate temperament. It is
    the graces of chivalry, not its fiery ardor, that he cultivates
    and reflects, and though "arms and the man" have often been his
    theme, the soft and delicate strain was ever more suggestive of
    the pastoral pipe than of the bardic lyre. Essayist, historian,
    biographer, novelist, he is always intent to smooth away the
    asperities of his subject, and, like some stately grandame
    enthroned in high-backed chair, he remembers that his simple
    auditors are to be not merely entertained by the matter of his
    discourse, but impressed by the suave tones and high-bred
    prolixity of the speaker. With a dignified courtesy unknown in
    these latter times&mdash;when biographers and historians do not
    scruple to take liberties with their heroes to the extent even
    of designating them by nicknames&mdash;the subject of the
    present memoir is introduced to us as <i>Mr</i>. Brassey, a
    form not only adopted on the title-page, but preserved in the
    body of the work, where we read that "Mr. Brassey was born
    November 7, 1805," that "Mr. Brassey, at twelve years of age,
    went to a school at Chester," and that, being afterward
    articled to a surveyor, "Mr. Brassey was permitted by his
    master" to assist in making certain surveys. It is only from a
    side whisper to the American public, which is honored with a
    preface all to itself, that we are permitted to learn that the
    great contractor owned to the Christian name of Thomas. Besides
    the two prefaces there is a dedication to the queen, an
    introduction telling how Sir Arthur Helps made the acquaintance
    of Mr. Brassey and what impressions he received from the
    interview, and a preliminary chapter containing a brief outline
    of Mr. Brassey's character as "a man of business;" so that we
    get at the substance of the book by a process like that which
    in a well-conducted household precedes the carving and
    distribution of a Christmas cake, any eagerness we might feel
    to "put in a thumb and pull out a plum" being kept in check by
    a proper amount of ceremony and tissue-paper.</p>

    <p>Plums, however, there are, though not perhaps in full
    proportion to the frosted coating, or of just the kind that are
    best agglutinated by the biographical dough. Of anecdote or
    gossip, glimpses of "life and manners" or personal details,
    there is nothing. Nor can we justly take exception to this. On
    the contrary, it gives a unity to the subject by excluding
    whatever had no relation to the enterprises with which Mr.
    Brassey's name is connected, and which absorbed his time and
    thoughts to a degree that can have left him but little
    opportunity for intercourse with mankind except in a business
    capacity. It is these enterprises&mdash;not in their entirety
    or with reference to the objects with which they were designed,
    but as evidences and illustrations of the working force, mental
    and physical, demanded for their execution&mdash;that form the
    real subject of the book, the matter of which has been chiefly
    furnished by the various agents entrusted with the immediate
    supervision of the labor and outlay of the capital employed.
    The details thus brought together afford perhaps a more vivid
    idea of the industrial energy and activity of the nineteenth
    century, and of the resources they have called into play, than
    could have been obtained from a survey of any other field in
    which the like qualities have been displayed. It was chiefly
    with railway enterprises, and this almost from their inception,
    and to an extent far beyond the rivalry of any other
    constructor, that Mr. Brassey was engaged; and the railway
    system, not only by its own immense demands on capital, labor
    and inventive skill, but still more by the stimulus and aid it
    has given to industrial enterprises of every kind, must be
    regarded <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> as the main lever of a
       material progress that has outstripped the conceptions and
       possibilities of all previous ages. With the development of
       a system so different in its nature from the great
       undertakings of any former period came the need of the
       contractor, entrusted with the direction and laden with the
       full responsibility of works which no government "boards" or
       similar machinery would have been competent to carry through
       under the conditions imposed by the novel circumstances of
       the movement and the exacting spirit by which it was
       impelled. To attain the foremost place in the new career
       thus created demanded, obviously, no ordinary
       powers&mdash;special knowledge of various kinds, equal
       facility in mastering details and grasping a general plan,
       tact in the choice and management of subordinates, courage
       and promptness in encountering unforeseen obstacles and
       disasters, and skill and clearheadedness in the general
       control of enormous and intricate financial interests. To
       these qualities must be added in the present case what is
       not so invariably associated with the names of succesful
       contractors&mdash;a faithfulness and integrity which merited
       and received the fullest confidence. Whether working at a
       gain or at a loss, Mr. Brassey was ever resolute to execute
       his engagements to the letter, and he declined to make
       demands for extra compensation when his contracts proved
       unprofitable, though it was customary with him to make good
       the losses of his sub-contractors. He amassed a colossal
       fortune, not through excessive gains, but by a small
       profit&mdash;"as nearly as possible three per
       cent."&mdash;which accrued to him from all his enterprises
       taken as a whole, and the accumulations consequent on an
       inexpensive mode of life.</p>

    <p>The railways constructed by Mr. Brassey, generally in
    partnership with some other contractor, between the years 1834
    and 1870, comprised between six and seven thousand miles in all
    parts of the globe, including Australia and in almost every
    civilized country except Russia and the United States. "There
    were periods in his career during which he and his partners
    were giving employment to 80,000 persons, upon works requiring
    &pound; 17,000,000 of capital for their completion." Yet a
    large part of his time and of the time of his agents was spent
    in the investigation of schemes which he either decided not to
    undertake or for which he tendered unsuccessfully. It was
    necessary at times to transport materials, a large staff of
    employ&eacute;s and an army of laborers from one country to
    another. In some cases works were prosecuted in regions
    occupied or threatened by hostile armies, in others under all
    the embarrassments and gloom of a great financial revulsion. In
    countries where commercial transactions were usually very
    limited the great difficulty was to obtain coin for the payment
    of wages, while in others there was the danger of the supply of
    labor failing through the enticements of superabundant capital
    or the more dazzling temptations of gold-digging. It is
    needless to mention the usual accidents and impediments to
    which all such undertakings are liable, and which the skill and
    ingenuity of the modern engineer never fail to overcome; but it
    is certainly not a little remarkable, when the multiplicity of
    Mr. Brassey's contracts is remembered, as well as the early
    period from which they date, to find that they were invariably
    completed within the specified time.</p>

    <p>Personal Reminiscences of Barham, Harness and Hodder.
    (Bric-&agrave;-Brac Series, edited by Richard Henry Stoddard.)
    New York: Scribner, Armstrong &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>Why we should love so dearly a fresh anecdote of a literary
    celebrity, a new quip by Talleyrand, a new stutter of Lamb's, a
    new impertinence of Sheridan's, may be not hard to understand,
    but it is rather hard to defend, any regard being paid to our
    dignity. The best stories about that particular line of authors
    who have possessed <i>bonhomie</i> and become classic for it
    are long since told. What remains is the dregs. Yet the other
    day we found ourselves smiling with real delight over a new
    "bit" of Cowper. It was merely that his barber, being late with
    the poet's wig, said, "Twill soon be here, it is upon the
    road;" and that Cowper had smiled, with a "Very well, William,"
    or a "Very fair, Thomas." The <i>mot</i>, like most of the
    stories that crop up now, was not good; it did not exhibit the
    author of "John Gilpin" in a brilliant light; it was not even
    uttered by the poet&mdash;he had merely smiled at it; yet it
    had the effect of rekindling the vapid embers about the dear
    old hearthstone of Olney, and the shy, gentle creatures that
    used to disport there among the hares when nobody was looking
    became for a moment more real from the citation. Now, the
    question is, What is the superiority of a new piece of gossip
    like this, which involves
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> no witticism and confers no
       wisdom, over the next bit of history that will be exchanged
       between the heroines of the alley-gate? When Mrs. Jones
       tells Mrs. Baker that Mrs. Briggs has delivered a daughter,
       and that Mr. Briggs said he had rather she had given him a
       wooden leg, the epigram is quite as good as a
       <i>Bric-&agrave;-Brac</i> anecdote, the people are quite as
       worthy as Cowper's barber, and the effect upon the history
       of letters quite as close and important. With this demurrer,
       we will apply ourselves for a moment to Mr. Stoddard's last
       collection, which of course we relish as much as anybody. We
       could wish that, after discharging his very well-executed
       duty of writing the preface, he could find some further time
       for elucidating the text. The present book being about three
       people, whose memoirs are taken from three volumes, it is
       confusing to the reader to find on a page headed "Rogers" or
       "Scott" a foot-note about what "my father" said or what "my
       friend" remembered, without anything to point out that the
       authority is other than Mr. Stoddard's father or friend.
       Other peculiarities, too, suggest that the pretty little
       volume is clipped instead of edited: on page 134 we find
       that "William, who had lived many years with Hook, grew rich
       and saucy. The latter used to assert of him that for the
       first three years he was as good a servant as ever came into
       a house; for the next two a kind and considerate friend; and
       afterward an abominably bad master." And on page 240, that
       when <i>Rogers</i> was condoled with about the death of an
       old servant, he exclaimed, "Well, I don't know that I feel
       his loss so much, after all. For the first <i>seven</i>
       years he was an obliging servant; for the second
       <i>seven</i> years an agreeable companion; but for the last
       seven years he was a tyrannical master." This duality of
       epigrams seems to show a discrepancy somewhere; or are we to
       believe that the wits of the Regency used to drive their
       jokes as hired hacks, like the livery carriages employed by
       faded dowagers in Hampton Court? The rest of the little book
       is perhaps free from duplicates. It is a good one to turn
       over for an hour in the cars, which is perhaps all it claims
       to be. The anecdotes are good old familiar anecdotes, but it
       is pleasant to have them strung on a thread. We are reminded
       that the original Bride of Lammermoor was a Miss Dalrymple;
       that the "laughing Tom" of Thackeray's "Ballad of
       Bouillabaise" was Thomas Frazer, Paris correspondent of the
       <i>Morning Chronicle</i>; that the dramatist of <i>Nicholas
       Nickleby</i>, so savagely assaulted by Dickens in the course
       of the work, was a Mr. Moncrief, who would never have
       prepared the story for the stage if Dickens had intimated
       his objection.</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
